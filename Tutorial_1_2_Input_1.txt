anarchism is political philosophy and movement that rejects all involuntary coercive forms of hierarchy it calls for the abolition of the state which it holds to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful it is usually described alongside libertarian marxism as the libertarian wing libertarian socialism of the socialist movement and as having historical association with anti capitalism and socialism the history of anarchism goes back to prehistory when some humans lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states realms or empires with the rise of organised hierarchical bodies skepticism toward authority also rose but it was not until the th century that self conscious political movement emerged during the latter half of the th and the first decades of the th century the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had significant role in workers struggles for emancipation various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period anarchists have taken part in several revolutions most notably in the spanish civil war whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism in the last decades of the th century and into the st century the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more anarchism employs various tactics in order to meet its ideal ends these can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics there is significant overlap between the two which are merely descriptive revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state and have taken violent turn in the past evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like anarchist thought criticism and praxis have played part in diverse areas of human society criticism of anarchism mainly focuses on claims of it being internally inconsistent violent and utopian etymology terminology and definition the etymological origin of anarchism is from the ancient greek anarkhia meaning without ruler composed of the prefix an without and the word arkhos leader or ruler the suffix ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy anarchism appears in english from as anarchisme and anarchy from various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists many revolutionaries of the th century such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but they did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid th century since the and beginning in france libertarianism has often been used as synonym for anarchism and its use as synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently hence it might be true to say that anarchism is cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and hierarchical organization including the state capitalism nationalism and all associated institutions in the conduct of all human relations in favour of society based on voluntary association on freedom and on but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology which is simply negation of ruler or based on anti statism anarchism is much more than that or even the anti authoritarian which is an posteriori conclusion nonetheless major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following the will for non coercive society the rejection of the state apparatus the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such non coercive society suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy history pre modern era zeno of citium bc whose republic inspired peter kropotkin during the prehistoric era of mankind an established authority did not exist it was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as reaction most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in china and greece in china philosophical anarchism the discussion on the legitimacy of the state was delineated by taoist philosophers zhuang zhou and laozi anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness cynics dismissed human law nomos and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature physis stoics were supportive of society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of state during the middle ages there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the muslim world or in christian europe this kind of tradition later gave birth to religious anarchism in the sasanian empire mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy only to be soon executed by emperor kavad in basra religious sects preached against the state in europe various sects developed anti state and libertarian tendencies libertarian ideas further emerged during the renaissance with the spread of reasoning and humanism through europe novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism the enlightenment further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress modern era during the french revolution partisan groups such as the enragés and the saw turning point in the fermentation of anti state and federalist sentiments the first anarchist currents developed throughout the th century william godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england morally delegitimizing the state max stirner thinking paved the way to individualism and pierre joseph proudhon theory of mutualism found fertile soil in france this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the spanish civil war of and is considered the golden age of anarchism anarchist mikhail bakunin opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists drawing from mutualism mikhail bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the international workingmen association class worker union later known as the first international that formed in to unite diverse revolutionary currents the international became significant political force with karl marx being leading figure and member of its general council bakunin faction the jura federation and proudhon followers the mutualists opposed marxist state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings after bitter disputes the bakuninists were expelled from the international by the marxists at the hague congress bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by marx terms they would end up the new tyrants of workers after being expelled anarchists formed the st imier international under the influence of peter kropotkin russian philosopher and scientist anarcho communism overlapped with collectivism anarcho communists who drew inspiration from the paris commune advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one needs at the turn of the century anarchism had spread all over the world in china small groups of students imported the humanistic pro science version of anarcho communism tokyo was hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east travelling to the japanese capital to study in latin america argentina was stronghold for anarcho syndicalism where it became the most prominent left wing ideology during this time minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence this strategy became known as propaganda of the deed the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune favoured individualist political expression and acts even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts infamy came upon the movement illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period nestor makhno with members of the anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchists participated in the russian revolution despite concerns in opposition to the whites however they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government was stabilized several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine notably leading to the kronstadt rebellion and nestor makhno struggle in the free territory with the anarchists being crushed in russia two new antithetical currents emerged namely platformism and synthesis anarchism the former sought to create coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble political party seeing the victories of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states members of major syndicalist movements the general confederation of labour and industrial workers of the world left their organisations and joined the communist international in the spanish civil war anarchists and syndicalists cnt and fai once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists long tradition of spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing pivotal role in the war in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land the soviet union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war but the result was bitter fight among communists and anarchists at series of events named may days as joseph stalin tried to seize control of the republicans post war era rojava supports efforts for workers to form cooperatives such as this sewing cooperative at the end of world war ii the anarchist movement was severely weakened however the witnessed revival of anarchism likely caused by perceived failure of marxism leninism and tensions built by the cold war during this time anarchism took root in other movements critical towards both the state and capitalism such as the anti nuclear environmental and pacifist movements the new left and the counterculture of the anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols and the established feminist tendencies of anarcha feminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the world trade organization the group of eight and the world economic forum during the protests ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with the police other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet significant event of this period was the confrontations at the wto conference in seattle in anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatistas in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria more commonly known as rojava de facto autonomous region in northern syria thought anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions social anarchism and individualist anarchism owing to their different origins values and evolution the individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership in chronological sense anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late th century and the post classical currents such as anarcha feminism green anarchism and post anarchism developed thereafter beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of minimal state but argues that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have central role in anarchist philosophy one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time despite separation the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but as tendencies that intermingle anarchism is usually placed on the far left of the political spectrum much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian anti statist and libertarian interpretations of the radical left wing and socialist politics of collectivism communism individualism mutualism and syndicalism among other libertarian socialist economic theories as anarchism does not offer fixed body of doctrine from single particular worldview many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely classical pierre joseph proudhon the primary proponent of anarcho mutualism who influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism collectivist communist and syndicalist they differ on organizational and economic aspects of their ideal society mutualism is an th century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by pierre joseph proudhon its aims include reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform that would be regulated by bank of the people mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism proudhon first characterised his goal as third form of society the synthesis of communism and property collectivist anarchism also known as anarchist collectivism or anarcho collectivism is revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and that workers be paid according to time worked rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism collectivist anarchism arose alongside marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of collectivist stateless society anarcho communism also known as anarchist communism communist anarchism and libertarian communism is theory of anarchism that advocates communist society with common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need anarcho communism developed from radical socialist currents after the french revolution but it was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of peter kropotkin anarcho syndicalism also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism is branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with new society democratically self managed by workers the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are workers solidarity direct action and workers self management individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include william godwin max stirner and henry david thoreau through many countries individualist anarchism attracted small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation post classical and contemporary lawrence jarach left and john zerzan right two prominent contemporary anarchist authors with zerzan being prominent voice within anarcho primitivism and jarach noted advocate of post left anarchy anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti globalization movement whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation as the movement shaped st century radicalism wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled revival of interest contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchism historical association with chaos and violence although its publicity has also led more scholars to engage with the anarchist movement anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches the anti capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents various anarchist groups tendencies and schools of thought exist today making it difficult to describe contemporary anarchist movement while theorists and activists have established relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles there is no consensus on which principles are core as result commentators describe multiple anarchisms rather than singular anarchism in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently for example gender equality can be common principle but ranks as higher priority to anarcha feminists than anarchist communists anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms namely all centralized and hierarchical forms of government monarchy representative democracy state socialism etc economic class systems capitalism bolshevism feudalism slavery etc autocratic religions fundamentalist islam roman catholicism etc patriarchy heterosexism white supremacy and imperialism however anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed tactics anarchists tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals first to oppose the establishment and second to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society illustrating the unity of means and ends broad categorization can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means and aims to change society through evolutionary means evolutionary tactics reject violence and take gradual approach to anarchist aims though there is significant overlap between the two anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century anarchists during the early th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use broader array of approaches classical era tactics the relationship between anarchism and violence is controversial subject among anarchists pictured is leon czolgosz assassinating president william mckinley during the classical era anarchists had militant tendency not only did they confront state armed forces as in spain and ukraine but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state some of which were successful anarchists also took part in revolutions anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial on one hand anarcho pacifists point out the unity of means and ends on the other hand other anarchist groups advocate direct action tactic which can include acts of sabotage or even acts of terrorism this attitude was quite prominent century ago seeing the state as tyrant some anarchists believed that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible emma goldman and errico malatesta who were proponents of limited use of violence argued that violence is merely reaction to state violence as necessary evil anarchists took an active role in strikes although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism seeing it as reformist they saw it as part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts some of whom practiced nudism they also built communities which were based on friendship they were also involved in the press revolutionary tactics in the current era italian anarchist alfredo bonanno proponent of insurrectionary anarchism has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late th century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards both bonanno and the french group the invisible committee advocate for small informal affiliation groups where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state capitalism and other enemies members of the invisible committee were arrested in on various charges terrorism included overall today anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots especially in countries like canada mexico or greece μilitant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police however anarchists not only clash with state operators they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists taking anti fascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening evolutionary tactics anarchists commonly employ direct action this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy or the form of self managing their lives through the creation of counter institutions such as communes and non hierarchical collectives often decision making is handled in an anti authoritarian way with everyone having equal say in each decision an approach known as horizontalism contemporary era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are not explicitly anarchist but are more or less based on horizontalism respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations the newly coined term small anarchism in contrast with the big anarchism of the classical era signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical era anarchism or to refer to kropotkin or proudhon to justify their opinions they would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize the decision making process of small affinity anarchist groups play significant tactical role anarchists have employed various methods in order to build rough consensus among members of their group without the need of leader or leading group one way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting specific point minorities usually accept rough consensus except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist goals values or ethics anarchists usually form small groups individuals to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members these kind of groups more often than not interconnect with each other forming larger networks anarchists still support and participate in strikes especially wildcat strikes these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by syndicate anarchists have gone online to spread their message as in the past newspapers and journals are used however because of distributional and other difficulties anarchists have found it easier to create websites hosting electronic libraries and other portals anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free the way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals especially when it comes to preserving users privacy from state surveillance anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied they are often called temporary autonomous zones taz spaces where surrealism poetry and art are blended to display the anarchist ideal as seen by anarchists squatting is way to regain urban space from the capitalist market serving pragmatical needs and is also seen an exemplary direct action acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds adding up these tactics and having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events make up carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity key issues as anarchism is philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought and disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory for instance the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism communism collectivism and trade unionism anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilisation technology within anarcho primitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others gender sexuality and free love french individualist anarchist émile armand propounded the virtues of free love in the parisian anarchist milieu of the early th century gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy anarchism is obliged to address analyse and oppose the suppression of one autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose historical current that arose and flourished during and within anarchism was free love in contemporary anarchism this current survives as tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism free love advocates were against marriage which they saw as way of men imposing authority over women largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men the notion of free love though was much broader it included critique of the established order that limited women sexual freedom and pleasure such free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses where large groups of travelers anarchists and other activists slept in beds together free love had roots both in europe and the united states some anarchists however struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love anarchist feminists were advocates of free love against marriage were pro choice utilizing contemporary term and had likewise agenda anarchist and non anarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were nonetheless supportive of one another during the second half of the th century anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism radicalizing some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well by the latest decades of the th century anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women gays queers and other marginalized groups with some feminist thinkers suggesting fusion of the two currents with the third wave of feminism sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became subject of study for anarchists which yielded post structuralist critique of sexual normality however some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking suggesting that it leaned towards individualism and was therefore dropping the cause of social liberation anarchism and education anarchist vs statist perspectives on educationruth kinna anarchist education state education concept education as self mastery education as service management community based state run methods practice based learning vocational training aims being critical member of society being productive member of society the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism anarchists consider proper education which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society to be an act of mutual aid anarchist writers such as willian godwin and max stirner attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges in catalan anarchist and free thinker francisco ferrer established the escuela moderna in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the catholic church ferrer approach was secular rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process and gave pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later arrested his ideas however formed the inspiration for series of modern schools around the world christian anarchist leo tolstoy also established similar school with its founding principle according to tolstoy being that for education to be effective it had to be free in similar token neill founding what became summerhill school in also declaring being free from coercion anarchist education is based largely on the idea that child right to develop freely without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality will lead children to morally good conclusions however there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation ferrer for example believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism along with other critiques of nationalism and government late th century and contemporary anarchist writers such as colin ward herbert read and paul goodman intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education largely focusing on the need for system that focuses on children creativity rather than on their ability to attain career or participate in consumer society contemporary anarchists such as colin ward have further argued that state education serves to perpetuate socio economic inequality while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern day major tenets of anarchist schools such as respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as teaching method have spread among mainstream educational institutions anarchism and the state objection to the state and its institutions is sine qua non of anarchism anarchists consider the state as tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life major decisions are taken by small elite authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless of whether that power is open or transparent as it still has the ability to coerce people another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting government even the most altruistic among officials will unavoidably seek to gain more power leading to corruption anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society anarchism and art les chataigniers osny by anarchist painter camille pissarro th century neo impressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism in this specific painting note how the blending of aestetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists surrealists and others while in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the new apocalyptics and the neo romanticism movement in music anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read argued that the border between the artist and the non artist what separates art from daily act is construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living joyful life other anarchists advocated for or used art as means to achieve anarchist ends in his book breaking the spell history of anarchist filmmakers videotape guerrillas and digital ninjas chris robé claims that anarchist inflected practices have increasingly structured movement based video activism throughout the th century many prominent anarchists such as peter kropotkin emma goldman gustav landauer and camillo berneri and publications such as anarchy wrote about matters pertaining to the arts three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists it could depict critique of existing society and hierarchies it could serve as prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and also it could turn into means of direct action in protests for example as it appeals to both emotion and reason art could appeal to the whole human and have powerful effect criticism the most common critique of anarchism is that humans can not self govern and state is necessary for human survival philosopher bertrand russell supported this critique noting that peace and war tariffs regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs the preservation of just system of distribution these among others are functions which could hardly be performed in community in which there was no central government philosophy lecturer andrew fiala also believed that humans could not self govern and included it in his list of arguments against anarchism fiala other critiques were that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction not only in the pragmatic world at protests but in the world of ethics as well secondly anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state can not be defeated practically this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it the third argument is that anarchism is self contradictory since while it advocates for no one to archiei if accepted by the many then anarchism will turn into the ruling political theory in this line of criticism also comes the self contradiction that anarchist calls for collective action while anarchism endorses the autonomy of the individual and hence no collective action can be taken lastly fiala mentions critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective all talk and thoughts and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro anarchist books such as john simmons moral principles and political obligations law professor william edmundson authored an essay arguing against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious edmundson claims that while the individual does not owe normal state duty of obedience this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate academic john molyneux notes in his book anarchism marxist criticism that anarchism cannot win believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas notable political critics of anarchism include vladimir lenin who wrote in that it produced general platitudes against exploitation but that anarchism lacked understanding of the causes of exploitation the development of society and class struggle see also anarchism by country governance without government list of anarchist political ideologies list of books about anarchism

autism is developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child life these signs often develop gradually though some children with autism experience worsening in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at normal pace autism is associated with combination of genetic and environmental factors risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections such as rubella toxins including valproic acid alcohol cocaine pesticides lead and air pollution fetal growth restriction and autoimmune diseases controversies surround other proposed environmental causes for example the vaccine hypothesis which has been disproven autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm combines autism and less severe forms of the condition including asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pdd nos into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder asd early behavioral interventions or speech therapy can help children with autism gain self care social and communication skills although there is no known cure there have been cases of children who recovered some autistic adults are unable to live independently an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking cure and others believing autism should be accepted as difference to be accommodated instead of cured globally autism is estimated to affect million people in the the number of people affected was estimated at per people worldwide in the developed countries about of children are diagnosed with asd from in in the united states it occurs four to five times more often in males than females the number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the which may be partly due to changes in diagnostic practice the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved characteristics autism is highly variable disorder whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood and generally follows steady course without remission people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but average or even superior in others overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form it is distinguished by characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and repetitive behavior other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits social development social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with typical neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things three to five year old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to lower ability to define person own emotions children with high functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and meltdowns communication about third to half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver in the second and third years children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd for example they may look at pointing hand instead of the pointed at object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language in pair of studies high functioning children with autism aged performed equally well as and as adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends repetitive behavior young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in row autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scale revised rbs categorizes as follows stereotyped behaviors repetitive movements such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking compulsive behaviors time consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules such as placing objects in specific order checking things or hand washing sameness resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted ritualistic behavior unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or dressing ritual this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors restricted interests interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus such as preoccupation with single television program toy or game self injury behaviors such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging no single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors other symptoms autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family an estimated to of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population sensory abnormalities are found in over of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements an estimated of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly diagnostic indicator selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur there is tentative evidence that autism occurs more frequently in people with gender dysphoria problems are one of the most commonly associated medical disorders in people with autism these are linked to greater social impairment irritability behavior and sleep problems language impairments and mood changes parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship however they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults causes it has long been presumed that there is common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism characteristic triad of symptoms however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur deletion duplication and inversion are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism autism has strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents studies of twins suggest that heritability is for autism and as high as for asd and siblings of those with autism are about times more likely to be autistic than the general population however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified typically autism cannot be traced to mendelian single gene mutation or to single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene most loci individually explain less than of cases of autism the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation such as deletions duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis hence substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily male condition but genetic phenomena such as imprinting and linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males and theories have been put forward for genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often such as the imprinted brain theory and the extreme male brain theory maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal intrauterine growth restriction is associated with asd in both term and preterm infants maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues aggravating genetic problem or damaging the nervous system exposure to air pollution during pregnancy especially heavy metals and particulates may increase the risk of autism environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods infectious diseases solvents pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress some such as the mmr vaccine have been completely disproven parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of routine vaccination this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload vaccine preservative or the mmr vaccine for causing autism the latter theory was supported by litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children mechanism autism symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain how autism occurs is not well understood its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the linkages between brain structures and behaviors the behaviors appear to have multiple there is evidence that gut brain axis abnormalities may be involved review proposed that immune dysregulation inflammation malfunction of the autonomic nervous system gut flora alterations and food metabolites may cause brain and dysfunction review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play role in neurological disorders such as autism neural connections and the immune system are pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as cause of autism some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development diagnosis diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism under the dsm autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities these deficits are present in early childhood typically before age three and lead to clinically significant functional impairment sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome intellectual disability or global developmental delay icd uses essentially the same definition several diagnostic instruments are available two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interview revised adi is semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders disco may also be used pediatrician commonly performs preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions pediatric is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and specific language impairment such as landau kleffner syndrome the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest genetic cause although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile testing genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome copy number variations as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism genetics metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than three year old to continue to do so few years later in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits girls are often diagnosed later than boys underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms classification autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pdd nos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for more specific disorder unlike with autism people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger syndrome and pdd nos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably asd in turn is subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome hfa and non syndromal autism is unclear some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to loss of language or social skills as opposed to failure to make progress typically from to months of age the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is specific subtype or that there is continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior spectrum autism has long been thought to cover wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent developmentally disabled and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism lfa mfa and hfa based on iq thresholds some people have called for an end to the terms high functioning and low functioning due to lack of nuance and the potential for person needs or abilities to be overlooked screening about half of parents of children with asd notice their child unusual behaviors by age months and about four fifths notice by age months according to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome no response to name or eye to eye gaze by months no babbling by months no gesturing pointing waving etc by months no single words by months no two word spontaneous not just echolalic phrases by months loss of any language or social skills at any age the united states preventive services task force in found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns the japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at and months using autism specific formal screening tests in contrast in the uk children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened it is not known which approach is more effective screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers chat the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year inventory initial data on chat and its predecessor the checklist for autism in toddlers chat on children aged months suggests that it is best used in clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives it may be more accurate to precede these tests with broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders screening tools designed for one culture norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for different culture although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features prevention while infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than of cases of autism vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases management three year old with autism points to fish in an aquarium as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive shared attention training on language development the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence in general higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child needs families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment services should be carried out by behavior analysts special education teachers speech pathologists and licensed psychologists studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy however the development of evidence based interventions has advanced in recent years although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care communication and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated while medications have not been found to help with core symptoms they may be used for associated symptoms such as irritability inattention or repetitive behavior patterns education educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy and cognitive behavioral interventions in adults without intellectual disability to reduce depression anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focalize treatment on specific area of deficit the quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention eibi treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the structured type of aba that is carried out with very young children is currently low and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic aba interventions and developmental social pragmatic models dsp one interventional strategy utilizes parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at home parent implementation despite the recent development of parent training models these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies being evaluated as probable efficacious mode of treatment early intensive aba therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children it is also well established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group similarly teacher implemented intervention that utilizes more naturalistic form of aba combined with developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social communication skills in young children although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in gap between what report recommends and what education is provided it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is subject of current debate among educators and researchers medication medications may be used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails they may also be used for associated health problems such as adhd or anxiety more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics the atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are fda approved for treating associated aggressive and self injurious behaviors however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits and people with autism may respond atypically side effects for example may include weight gain tiredness drooling and aggression ssri antidepressants such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with co morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd no known medication relieves autism core symptoms of social and communication impairments experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism alternative medicine although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance some alternative treatments may place the child at risk the preference that children with autism have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on casein free diets as consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin however suboptimal bone development in asd has also been associated with lack of exercise and disorders in botched chelation therapy killed five year old child with autism chelation is not recommended for people with asd since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is cease therapy mixture of homeopathy supplements and vaccine detoxing although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism as of there is no good evidence to recommend gluten and casein free diet as standard treatment review concluded that it may be therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism such as those with known food intolerances or allergies or with food intolerance markers the authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten and casein free diet in children with asd in total all of them compared gluten and casein free diet versus normal diet with control group double blind randomized controlled trials double blind crossover trial single blind trial in two of the studies whose duration was and months significant improvement in asd symptoms efficacy rate was identified in the other two studies whose duration was months no significant effect was observed the authors concluded that longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the asd symptoms other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet small sample size the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of placebo effect in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors results of systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support mindfulness based interventions for improving mental health this includes decreasing stress anxiety ruminating thoughts anger and aggression there is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions verbal communication and non verbal communication skills there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects prognosis there is no known cure the degree of symptoms can decrease occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of asd this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not it is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from to most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger though few have developed communication skills in later years many children with autism lack social support future employment opportunities or self determination although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age few high quality studies address long term prognosis some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife acquiring language before age six having an iq above and having marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism many individuals with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood compared to the general population individuals with autism are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had job about half of people in their with autism are not employed epidemiology reports of autism cases per children grew dramatically in the us from to it is unknown how much if any growth came from changes in rates of autism most recent reviews tend to estimate prevalence of per for autism and close to per for asd as of survey in the united states reported rate of per children for asd globally autism affects an estimated million people while asperger syndrome affects further million in the nhs estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged years and over in the uk was rates of pdd nos has been estimated at per asperger syndrome at roughly per and childhood disintegrative disorder at per cdc estimates about out of for an increase from out of every children for the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the and early this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism true prevalence has increased real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics boys are at higher risk for asd than girls the sex ratio averages and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to with intellectual disability and more than without several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed one theory is that females are underdiagnosed although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism several other conditions are common in children with autism they include genetic disorders about of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome and asd is associated with several genetic disorders intellectual disability the percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from to wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing intelligence of individuals on the autism spectrum in comparison for pdd nos the association with intellectual disability is much weaker and by definition the diagnosis of asperger excludes intellectual disability anxiety disorders are common among children with asd there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from to many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself or are hard to distinguish from asd symptoms epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder several metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population preempted diagnoses although the dsm iv rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism the full criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd tourette syndrome and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted sleep problems affect about two thirds of individuals with asd at some point in childhood these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis history portrait of victor of aveyron feral child caught in who displayed possible symptoms of autism few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named the table talk of martin luther compiled by his notetaker mathesius contains the story of year old boy who may have been severely autistic luther reportedly thought the boy was soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report the earliest well documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue as detailed in court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair marriage to gain blair inheritance the wild boy of aveyron feral child caught in showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia he derived it from the greek word autós αὐτός meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance soviet child psychiatrist grunya sukhareva described similar syndrome that was published in russian in and in german in clinical development and diagnoses leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in the word autism first took its modern sense in when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler terminology autistic psychopaths in lecture in german about child psychology asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as separate diagnosis until leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in report of children with striking behavioral similarities almost all the characteristics described in kanner first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger donald triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism he was diagnosed by kanner after being first examined in and was labeled as case triplett was noted for his savant abilities particularly being able to name musical notes played on piano and to mentally multiply numbers his father oliver described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns music notes letters of the alphabet and president pictures by the age of he had the ability to recite the rd psalm and memorized questions and answers from the presbyterian catechism he was also interested in creating musical chords kanner reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant response to refrigerator mothers starting in the late autism was established as separate syndrome terminology and distinction from schizophrenia as late as the mid there was little evidence of genetic role in autism while in it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions although the rise of parent organizations and the of childhood asd have affected how asd is viewed parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child autistic behavior is perceived negatively and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research it took until for the dsm iii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia in the dsm iii provided checklist for diagnosing autism in may the dsm was released updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders the grouping of disorders including pdd nos autism asperger syndrome rett syndrome and cdd has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders the two categories that exist are impaired social communication and or interaction and restricted and or repetitive behaviors the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with and has given them way to form online communities and work remotely societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being society and culture autism awareness ribbon an autistic culture has emerged accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements events include world autism awareness day autism sunday autistic pride day autreat and others organizations dedicated to promoting awareness of autism include autistic self advocacy network aspies for freedom autism national committee and autism society of america at the same time some organizations including autism speaks have been condemned by disability rights organizations for failing to support autistic people social science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as culture transcultural comparisons and research on social movements while most autistic individuals do not have savant skills many have been successful in their fields autism rights movement the autism rights movement is social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity viewing the autism spectrum as result of natural variations in the human brain rather than disorder to be cured the autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism and the recognition of the autistic community as minority group autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as natural expression of the human genome this perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views the medical perspective that autism is caused by genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are high functioning or have asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of low functioning autistic people employment about half of autistics are unemployed and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed among autistics who find work most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum while employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care

diffusely reflected sunlight relative to various surface conditions albedo meaning whiteness is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on scale from corresponding to black body that absorbs all incident radiation to corresponding to body that reflects all incident radiation surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity to the irradiance flux per unit area received by surface the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earth surface these factors vary with atmospheric composition geographic location and time see position of the sun while bi hemispherical reflectance is calculated for single angle of incidence for given position of the sun albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in given period the temporal resolution may range from seconds as obtained from flux measurements to daily monthly or annual averages unless given for specific wavelength spectral albedo albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface between and μm this spectrum includes visible light μm which explains why surfaces with low albedo appear dark trees absorb most radiation whereas surfaces with high albedo appear bright snow reflects most radiation albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and environmental management as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design leed program for sustainable rating of buildings the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere its planetary albedo is because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his work photometria terrestrial albedo sample albedos surface typicalalbedo fresh asphalt open ocean worn asphalt conifer forest summer to deciduous forest to bare soil green grass desert sand new concrete ocean ice to fresh snow any albedo in visible light falls within range of about for fresh snow to about for charcoal one of the darkest substances deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of black body when seen from distance the ocean surface has low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are in an albedo range of to the average albedo of earth is about this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo earth surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for single direction by satellite not all directions mathematical model is used to translate sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf which describes how the reflectance of given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo earth average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about if earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about in contrast if the entire earth was covered by water so called ocean planet the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost white sky black sky and blue sky albedo for land surfaces it has been shown that the albedo at particular solar zenith angle can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directional hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle sometimes referred to as black sky albedo and the bi hemispherical reflectance sometimes referred to as white sky albedo with being the proportion of direct radiation from given solar angle and being the proportion of diffuse illumination the actual albedo also called blue sky albedo can then be given as this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface astronomical albedo the albedos of planets satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time composes major part of the astronomical field of photometry for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids enceladus moon of saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system with an albedo of another notable high albedo body is eris with an albedo of many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about typical comet nucleus has an albedo of such dark surface is thought to be indicative of primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around but it is strongly directional and non lambertian displaying also strong opposition effect although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected their values can differ significantly which is common source of confusion planet geometric bond mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces the correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is where is the astronomical albedo is the diameter in kilometers and is the absolute magnitude examples of terrestrial albedo effects illumination albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light except in circumstances where change in illumination induces change in the earth surface at that location through melting of reflective ice that said albedo and illumination both vary by latitude albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics with local maximum in the tropics insolation effects the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation whereas areas such as the sahara desert which also have relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation tropical and sub tropical rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation because insolation plays such big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the earth this has been concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker being water or ground which is darker color and reflects less heat back into space this feedback loop results in reduced albedo effect climate and weather albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation planet absorbs the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weather albedo temperature feedback when an area albedo changes due to snowfall snow temperature feedback results layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area warm air mass the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow temperature feedback however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass or soil the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating snow snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as for freshly fallen snow to about for melting snow and as low as for dirty snow over antarctica snow albedo averages little more than if marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the ice albedo positive feedback just as fresh snow has higher albedo than does dirty snow the albedo of snow covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow when sea ice melts either due to rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above the snow covered surface is reduced and more surface of sea water is exposed so the rate of energy absorption increases the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts as with the preceding example of snowmelt the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of positive feedback both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates because of this in order to reduce the error of energy estimates it is important to measure the albedo of snow covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying single value for albedo over broad regions small scale effects albedo works on smaller scale too in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing solar photovoltaic effects albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices for example the effects of spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon si and crystalline silicon si based compared to traditional spectral integrated albedo predictions research showed impacts of over more recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of commonly occurring surface materials both human made and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications trees because forests generally have low albedo the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause net cooling effect trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat as net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are to higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily deciduous trees have an albedo value of about to whereas coniferous trees have value of about to variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy the result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes siberia were neutral or perhaps warming water reflectivity of smooth water at refractive index water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials the reflectivity of water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations see graph at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in locally specular manner not diffusely the glint of light off water is commonplace effect of this at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs incident angle curve and locally increased average incident angle although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from minimum of near to maximum approaching on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies aerosol effects aerosols very fine particles droplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on earth radiative balance the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain as per spracklen et al the effects are aerosol direct effect aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming aerosol indirect effect aerosols modify the properties of clouds through subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect black carbon another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is with range to black carbon is bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo human activities human activities deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects other types of albedo single scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles it depends on properties of the

or is the first letter and the first vowel letter of the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet its name in english is pronounced plural aes it is similar in shape to the ancient greek letter alpha from which it derives the uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of triangle crossed in the middle by horizontal bar the lowercase version can be written in two forms the double storey and single storey the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it especially fonts intended to be read by children and is also found in italic type in the english

the ancestor of aleph may have been pictogram of an ox head in proto sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as triangular head with two horns extended by bc the phoenician alphabet

capital aanother blackletter modern roman amodern roman modern italic amodern italic modern script amodern script when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for letter to represent the glottal stop the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english typographic variants different glyphs of the lowercase letter during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media there was also cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial typographic variants include double storey and single storey at the end of the roman empire th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain by the th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through combining of prior forms th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italic form also called script is used in most current handwriting and consists of circle and vertical stroke this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of small loop with an arc over it both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of text from the rest set in roman type there are some other cases aside from italic type where script also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin such as in the international phonetic alphabet use in writing

which is closer to its original latin and greek sound the diphthong as in ace and major usually when is followed by one or occasionally two consonants and then another vowel letter this results from middle english lengthening followed by the great vowel shift the modified form of the above sound that occurs before as in square and mary the rounded vowel of water the shorter rounded vowel not

alabama is state in the southeastern region of the united states it is bordered by tennessee to the north georgia to the east florida and the gulf of mexico to the south and mississippi to the west alabama is the th largest by area and the th most populous of the states with total of of inland waterways alabama has among the most of any state alabama is nicknamed the yellowhammer state after the state bird alabama is also known as the heart of dixie and the cotton state the state tree is the longleaf pine and the state flower is the camellia alabama capital is montgomery the largest city by population is birmingham which has long been the most industrialized city the largest city by land area is huntsville the oldest city is mobile founded by french colonists in as the capital of french louisiana greater birmingham is alabama largest urban economy its most populous urban area and its economic center from the american civil war until world war ii alabama like many states in the southern suffered economic hardship in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture similar to other former slave states alabamian legislators employed jim crow laws to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against african americans from the end of the reconstruction era up until at least the despite the growth of major industries and urban centers white rural interests dominated the state legislature from to the during this time urban interests and african americans were markedly under represented following world war ii alabama grew as the state economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests the state economy in the st century is based on management automotive finance manufacturing aerospace mineral extraction healthcare education retail and technology etymology the european american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river in the alabama language the word for person of alabama lineage is albaamo or variously albaama or albàamo in different dialects the plural form is albaamaha the suggestion that alabama was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely the word spelling varies significantly among historical sources the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of garcilaso de la vega used alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in of the term as early as the french called the tribe the alibamon with french maps identifying the river as rivière des alibamons other spellings of the name have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu allibamou sources disagree on the word meaning some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants the state has numerous place names of native american origin however there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language an article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant here we rest this notion was popularized in the through the writings of alexander beaufort meek experts in the muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such translation history pre european settlement the moundville archaeological site in hale county it was occupied by native americans of the mississippian culture from to ce indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of european colonization trade with the northeastern tribes by the ohio river began during the burial mound period bce ce and continued until european contact the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from to ce with one of its major centers built at what is now the moundville archaeological site in moundville alabama this is the second largest complex of the classic middle mississippian era after cahokia in present day illinois which was the center of the culture analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex secc contrary to popular belief the secc appears to have no direct links to mesoamerican culture but developed independently the ceremonial complex represents major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood among the historical tribes of native american people living in present day alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee an iroquoian language people and the muskogean speaking alabama alibamu chickasaw choctaw creek and koasati while part of the same large language family the muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages european settlement with exploration in the th century the spanish were the first europeans to reach alabama the expedition of hernando de soto passed through mabila and other parts of the state in more than years later the french founded the region first european settlement at old mobile in the city was moved to the current site of mobile in this area was claimed by the french from to as part of la louisiane after the french lost to the british in the seven years war it became part of british west florida from to after the united states victory in the american revolutionary war the territory was divided between the united states and spain the latter retained control of this western territory from until the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to forces on april thomas bassett loyalist to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile he settled in the tombigbee district during the early the district boundaries were roughly limited to the area within few miles of the tombigbee river and included portions of what is today southern clarke county northernmost mobile county and most of washington county what is now the counties of baldwin and mobile became part of spanish west florida in part of the independent republic of west florida in and was finally added to the mississippi territory in most of what is now the northern two thirds of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period it was claimed by the province of georgia from onwards following the revolutionary war it remained part of georgia although heavily disputed with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands what is now the lower one third of alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in the yazoo lands were added to the territory in following the yazoo land scandal spain kept claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the adams onís treaty officially ceded it to the united states in early th century before mississippi admission to statehood on december the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory the united states congress created the alabama territory on march st stephens now abandoned served as the territorial capital from to alabama was admitted as the nd state on december with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention from july to august delegates met to prepare the new state constitution huntsville served as temporary capital from to when the seat of government moved to cahaba in dallas county cahaba now ghost town was the first permanent state capital from to the alabama fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation part of the frontier in the and its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men thornhill in greene county it is former black belt plantation southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded the economy of the central black belt named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew mainly from slave labor the area also drew many poor disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers alabama had an estimated population of under people in but it increased to more than people by most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in from to tuscaloosa served as alabama capital on january the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery the first legislative session in the new capital met in december new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia the first structure burned down in but was rebuilt on the same site in this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day it was designed by barachias holt of exeter maine civil war and reconstruction by the population had increased to people of which nearly half were enslaved african americans and were free people of color on january alabama declared its secession from the union after remaining an independent republic for few days it joined the confederate states of america the confederacy capital was initially at montgomery alabama was heavily involved in the american civil war although comparatively few battles were fought in the state alabama contributed about soldiers to the war effort union army troops occupying courthouse square in huntsville following its capture and occupation by federal forces in company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville alabama joined nathan bedford forrest battalion in hopkinsville kentucky the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coat tails this led to them being greeted with yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army alabama slaves were freed by the th amendment in alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may until its official restoration to the union in from to with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state alabama was represented in congress during this period by three african american congressmen jeremiah haralson benjamin turner and james rapier following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton during reconstruction state legislators ratified new state constitution in which created the state first public school system and expanded women rights legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans besides the short lived original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white league reconstruction in alabama ended in when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governor office through an election dominated by fraud and violence they wrote another constitution in and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools railroad passenger cars were segregated in after most african americans and many poor whites in the constitution the alabama legislature passed more jim crow laws at the beginning of the th century to impose segregation in everyday life th century the developing skyline of birmingham in the new constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all african americans and native americans and tens of thousands of poor whites through making voter registration difficult requiring poll tax and literacy test the constitution required racial segregation of public schools by only african americans were registered in alabama although at least were literate this compared to more than african americans eligible to vote in the numbers dropped even more in later decades the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the jails were segregated in hospitals in toilets hotels and restaurants in and bus stop waiting rooms in while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their as well due mostly to the imposition of cumulative poll tax by whites constituted slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws whites vs african americans nearly all african americans had lost the ability to vote despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as well the former mount sinai school in rural autauga county completed in it was one of the rosenwald schools built in the state beginning in the first rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the th century as part of the great migration out of the south reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from to at the same time many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the magic city by birmingham was the th largest city in the united states heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late following lawsuit and court order industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between and more than people moved into the city to work for war related industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed manufacturing and service base despite massive population changes in the state from to the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas one result was that jefferson county containing birmingham industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently in the legislature study noted that because of rural domination minority of about per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature in the united states supreme court cases of baker carr and reynolds sims the court ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties in for the first time since the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been for more than sixty years other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts african americans continued to press in the and to end and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges in the supreme court ruled in brown board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply during the under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott freedom rides in and selma to montgomery marches these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of and voting rights act of by the congress legal segregation ended in the states in but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court according to the new york times by many of alabama african americans were living in alabama cities such as birmingham and montgomery also the black belt region across central alabama is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly african american these counties include dallas lowndes marengo and perry alabama has made some changes since the late th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation in the an omnibus redistricting case dillard crenshaw county challenged the at large voting for representative seats of alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards at large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at large jurisdictions as part of settlement of this case five alabama cities and counties including chilton county adopted system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi seat jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county in limited voting was first tested in conecuh county together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens geography alabama is the thirtieth largest state in the united states with of total area of the area is water making alabama rd in the

the alabama constitution which was ratified in at almost amendments and words it is by some accounts the world longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the united states constitution there has been significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabama constitution critics argue that alabama constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature leaving practically no power in local hands most counties do not have home rule any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and frequently by state referendum one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism heflin torbert judicial building in montgomery it houses the supreme court of alabama alabama court of civil appeals and alabama court of criminal appeals alabama government is divided into three coequal branches the legislative branch is the alabama legislature bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives with members and the alabama senate with members the legislature is responsible for writing debating passing or defeating state legislation the republican party currently holds majority in both houses of the legislature the legislature has the power to override gubernatorial veto by simple majority most state legislatures require two thirds majority to override veto until the state elected state senators on geographic basis by county with one per county it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in as result urbanized areas were grossly it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either in reynolds sims the supreme court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented further the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems at that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that urban areas and districts this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one third of the state budget but jefferson county received only th of state services in funding through the legislative delegations the alabama legislature kept control of county governments republican kay ivey is the current governor of alabama the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws it is headed by the governor of alabama other members of executive branch include the cabinet the lieutenant governor of alabama the attorney general of alabama the alabama secretary of state the alabama state treasurer and the state auditor of alabama the current governor is republican kay ivey the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections statewide officials such as the governor lieutenant governor attorney general and other constitutional officers take office the following january the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the state constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases the state highest court is the supreme court of alabama alabama uses partisan elections to select judges since the judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican tom parker all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party there are two intermediate appellate courts the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals and four trial courts the circuit court trial court of general jurisdiction and the district probate and municipal courts some critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country in some years it imposes more death sentences than does texas state which has population five times larger however executions per capita are significantly higher in texas some of its cases have been highly controversial the supreme court has overturned convictions in death penalty cases it was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use death sentence in cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole lwop that were voted unanimously by juries this judicial authority was removed in april taxes taxes are collected by the alabama department of revenue alabama levies or percent personal income tax depending on the amount earned and filing status taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax even if taking the standard deduction those who itemize can also deduct fica the social security and medicare tax the state general sales tax rate is sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases for example the total sales tax rate in mobile is and there is an additional restaurant tax of which means diner in mobile would pay an tax on meal sales and excise taxes in alabama account for of all state and local revenue compared with an average of about nationwide alabama is one of seven states that levy tax on food at the same rate as other goods and one of two states the other being neighboring mississippi which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low income families most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply lower tax rate alabama income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the alabama is the only state that levies income tax on family of four with income as low as which is barely one quarter the federal poverty line alabama threshold is the lowest among the states and the district of columbia with income taxes the corporate income tax rate is currently the overall federal state and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least tax burdened state in the country property taxes are the lowest in the the current state constitution requires voter referendum to raise property taxes since alabama tax structure largely depends on consumer spending it is subject to high variable budget structure for example in alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as million county and local governments alabama has counties each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission it also has limited executive authority in the county because of the constraints of the alabama constitution which centralizes power in the state legislature only seven counties jefferson lee mobile madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the alabama constitutional commission legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county united states supreme court decisions in baker carr required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census in order to implement the principle of one man one vote before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to under representation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties the rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution alabama constitution has been amended more than times and almost one third of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state meaning the state government holds monopoly on the sale of alcohol the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic

reconstruction following the american civil war alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope in the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the black vote through violence fraud and intimidation after coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents process completed in provisions of the constitution provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor whites by more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised to the total effects were greater on the black community as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law from through the the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and of certain areas as counties were the basis of election districts the result was rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three quarters of the century until series of federal court cases required redistricting in to meet equal representation alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the and during the civil rights movement when whites and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform governor george wallace the state only four term governor was controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation only after passage of the federal civil rights act of and voting rights act of did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights in many jurisdictions they continued to be excluded from representation by at large electoral systems which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single member districts that enable more diverse representation among county boards in the alabama legislature passed and republican governor bob riley signed resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact in symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol which housed congress of the confederate states of america in republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in years there are total of registered voters with active and the others inactive in the state elections doug jones won special election in state elections with the of blacks in the state became part of the solid south system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state for nearly hundred years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election since the mid to late th century however white conservatives started shifting to the republican party in alabama majority white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal state and local office members of the nine seats on the supreme court of alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office until no republicans held any of the court seats in that general election the then incumbent chief justice ernest hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately votes to republican perry hooper sr hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court this ultimately led to collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench in the early st century republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education in republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in years the last remaining statewide democrat who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in only three republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction when republicans generally represented reconstruction government including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise the three gop lieutenant governors are steve windom kay ivey and will ainsworth present local elections many local offices county commissioners boards of education tax assessors tax collectors etc in the state are still held by democrats many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority republican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary although there are exceptions alabama county sheriffs are elected in partisan at large races and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts the current split is democrats republicans and one independent fayette however most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban suburban and heavily populated counties the state of alabama has one female sheriff in morgan county alabama and ten african american sheriffs federal elections the state two senators are republican richard shelby and democrat doug jones shelby was originally elected to the senate as democrat in and re elected in but switched parties immediately following the november general election in the house of representatives the state is represented by seven members six of whom are republicans bradley byrne mike rogers

pottery painting dating to bc of achilles during the trojan war in greek mythology achilles or achilleus was hero of the trojan war the greatest of all the greek warriors and is the central character of homer iliad he was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus king of phthia achilles most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan prince hector outside the gates of troy although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris who shot him in the heel with an arrow later legends beginning with statius unfinished epic achilleid written in the st century ad state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel because when his mother thetis dipped him in the river styx as an infant she held him by one of his heels alluding to these legends the term achilles heel has come to mean point of weakness especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution the achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends etymology linear tablets attest to the personal name achilleus in the forms ki re and ki re we the latter being the dative of the former the name grew more popular even becoming common soon after the seventh century bc and was also turned into the female form ἀχιλλεία achilleía attested in attica in the fourth century bc ig ii² and in the form achillia on stele in halicarnassus as the name of female gladiator fighting an amazon achilles name can be analyzed as combination of distress pain sorrow grief and people soldiers nation resulting in proto form akhí lāu os he who has the people distressed or he whose people have distress the grief or distress of the people is theme raised numerous times in the iliad and frequently by achilles himself achilles role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of glory usually in war furthermore laós has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean corps of soldiers muster with this derivation the name obtains double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring distress to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership the education of achilles by eugène delacroix pastel on paper getty center los angeles another etymology relates the name to proto indo european compound h₂eḱ pṓds sharp foot which first gave an illyrian āk pediós evolving through time into ākhpdeós and then akhiddeús the shift from dd to ll is then ascribed to the passing of the name into greek via pre greek source the first root part h₂eḱ sharp pointed also gave greek ἀκή akḗ point silence healing ἀκμή akmḗ point edge zenith and ὀξύς oxús sharp pointed keen quick clever whereas ἄχος stems from the root h₂egʰ to be upset afraid the whole expression would be comparable to the latin acupedius swift of foot compare also the latin word family of aciēs sharp edge or point battle line battle engagement acus needle pin bodkin and acuō to make pointed sharpen whet to exercise to arouse whence acute some topical epitheta of achilles in the iliad point to this swift footedness namely ποδάρκης δῖος ἀχιλλεὺς podárkēs dĩos achilleús swift footed divine achilles or even more frequently πόδας ὠκὺς ἀχιλλεύς pódas ōkús achilleús quick footed achilles some researchers deem the name loan word possibly from pre greek language achilles descent from the nereid thetis and similarity of his name with those of river deities such as acheron and achelous have led to speculations about him being an old water divinity see below worship robert beekes has suggested pre greek origin of the name based among other things on the coexistence of λλ and in epic language which may account for palatalized phoneme ly in the original language birth and early years achilles was the son of the nereid thetis and of peleus the king of the myrmidons zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus the fore thinker warned zeus of prophecy originally uttered by themis goddess of divine law that thetis would bear son greater than his father for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed peleus thetis dipping the infant achilles into the river styx by peter paul rubens museum boijmans van beuningen rotterdam there is tale which offers an alternative version of these events in the argonautica zeus sister and wife hera alludes to thetis chaste resistance to the advances of zeus pointing out that thetis was so loyal to hera marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods thetis although daughter of the sea god nereus was also brought up by hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal chiron teaching achilles how to play the lyre roman fresco from herculaneum st century ad james barry yale center for british art according to the achilleid written by statius in the st century ad and to non surviving previous sources when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx however he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his left heel see achilles heel achilles tendon it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier in another version of this story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in rage none of the sources before statius make any reference to this general invulnerability to the contrary in the iliad homer mentions achilles being wounded in book the paeonian hero asteropaeus son of pelagon challenged achilles by the river scamander he cast two spears at once one grazed achilles elbow drawing spurt of blood also in the fragmentary poems of the epic cycle in which one can find description of the hero death the cypria the little iliad by lesches of pyrrha the aithiopis and iliou persis by arctinus of miletus there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel in the later vase paintings presenting the death of achilles the arrow or in many cases arrows hit his torso peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur on mount pelion to be reared thetis foretold that her son fate was either to gain glory and die young or to live long but uneventful life in obscurity achilles chose the former and decided to take part in the trojan war according to homer achilles grew up in phthia together with his companion patroclus according to photius the sixth book of the new history by ptolemy hephaestion reported that thetis burned in secret place the children she had by peleus but when she had achilles peleus noticed tore him from the flames with only burnt foot and confided him to the centaur chiron later chiron exhumed the body of the damysus who was the fastest of all the giants removed the ankle and incorporated it into achilles burnt foot other names among the appellations under which achilles is generally known are the following pyrisous saved from the fire his first name which seems to favour the tradition in which his mortal parts were burned by his mother thetis aeacides from his grandfather aeacus aemonius from aemonia country which afterwards acquired the name of thessaly aspetos inimitable or vast his name at epirus larissaeus from larissa also called cremaste town of thessaly which still bears the same name ligyron his original name nereius from his mother thetis one of the nereids pelides from his father peleus phthius from his birthplace phthia podarkes swift footed due to the wings of arke being attached to his feet hidden on skyros some post homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis or in some versions peleus hid the young man at the court of lycomedes king of skyros there achilles is disguised as girl and lives among lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name pyrrha the red haired girl with lycomedes daughter deidamia whom in the account of statius he rapes achilles there fathers son neoptolemus also called pyrrhus after his father possible alias according to this story odysseus learns from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid odysseus goes to skyros in the guise of peddler selling women clothes and jewellery and places shield and spear among his goods when achilles instantly takes up the spear odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the greek campaign in another version of the story odysseus arranges for trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women while the women flee in panic achilles prepares to defend the court thus giving his identity away in the trojan war achilles and agamemnon from mosaic from pompeii st century ad according to the iliad achilles arrived at troy with ships each carrying myrmidons he appointed five leaders each leader commanding myrmidons menesthius eudorus peisander phoenix and alcimedon telephus when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal guided by the oracle he arrived at argos where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed troilus achilles slaying troilus red figure kylix signed by euphronios according to the cypria the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles wrath when the achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas sacked neighbouring cities like pedasus and lyrnessus where the greeks capture the queen briseis and killed tenes son of apollo as well as priam son troilus in the sanctuary of apollo thymbraios however the romance between troilus and chryseis described in geoffrey chaucer troilus and criseyde and in william shakespeare troilus and cressida is medieval invention in dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe as well as in older accounts troilus was young trojan prince the youngest of king priam and hecuba five legitimate sons or according other sources another son of apollo despite his youth he was one of the main trojan war leaders horse fighter or chariot fighter according to homer prophecies linked troilus fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him yet achilles struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altar omphalos of apollo thymbraios later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over ardent lovers embrace in this version of the myth achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of dead child mourned by his parents had troilus lived to adulthood the first vatican mythographer claimed troy would have been invincible however the motif is older and found already in plautus bacchides in the iliad achilles cedes briseis to agamemnon from the house of the tragic poet in pompeii fresco st century ad naples national archaeological museum homer iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles deeds in the trojan war achilles wrath μῆνις ἀχιλλέως mênis achilléōs is the central theme of the poem the first two lines of the iliad read μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ πηληιάδεω ἀχιλῆος οὐλομένην μυρί ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε ἔθηκε sing goddess of the rage of peleus son achilles the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the achaeans the homeric epic only covers few weeks of the decade long war and does not narrate achilles death it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by agamemnon the commander of the achaean forces agamemnon has taken woman named chryseis as his slave her father chryses priest of apollo begs agamemnon to return her to him agamemnon refuses and apollo sends plague amongst the greeks the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him achilles does so and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father agamemnon consents but then commands that achilles battle prize briseis the daughter of briseus be brought to him to replace chryseis angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away and as he says later because he loves briseis with the urging of his mother thetis achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces at the same time burning with rage over agamemnon theft achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honour as the battle turns against the greeks thanks to the influence of zeus nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains ajax and phoenix to achilles with the offer of the return of briseis and other gifts achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do the rage of achilles fresco by giovanni battista tiepolo villa valmarana ai nani vicenza the trojans led by hector subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle wearing achilles armour though achilles remains at his camp patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches but is killed by hector before he can lead proper assault on the city of troy after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus the son of nestor achilles grieves over his beloved companion death his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles she persuades hephaestus to make new armour for him in place of the armour that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector the new armour includes the shield of achilles described in great detail in the poem enraged over the death of patroclus achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus zeus himself takes note of achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself finally achilles finds his prey achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena in the form of hector favorite and dearest brother deiphobus persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face after hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable wanting to go down fighting he charges at achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses accepting his fate hector begs achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw such agonies you have caused me achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot after having dream where patroclus begs achilles to hold his funeral achilles hosts series of funeral games in his honour at the onset of his duel with hector achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky which comes on in the autumn orion dog sirius sign of evil during the cremation of patroclus he is compared to hesperus the evening western star venus while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until phosphorus the morning eastern star also venus has set descended with the assistance of the god hermes argeiphontes hector father priam goes to achilles tent to plead with achilles for the return of hector body so that he can be buried achilles relents and promises truce for the duration of the funeral lasting days with burial on the th in the tradition of niobe offspring the poem ends with description of hector funeral with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come later epic accounts fighting penthesilea and memnon achilles and memnon fighting between thetis and eos attic black figure amphora bc from vulci the aethiopis th century bc and work named posthomerica composed by quintus of smyrna in the fourth century ad relate further events from the trojan war when penthesilea queen of the amazons and daughter of ares arrives in troy priam hopes that she will defeat achilles after his temporary truce with priam achilles fights and kills the warrior queen only to grieve over her death later at first he was so distracted by her beauty he did not fight as intensely as usual once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her following the death of patroclus nestor son antilochus becomes achilles closest companion when memnon son of the dawn goddess eos and king of ethiopia slays antilochus achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield killing memnon consequently eos will not let the sun rise until zeus persuades her the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus except that memnon unlike hector was also the son of goddess many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliad description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis which was composed after the iliad possibly in the th century bc the aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors achilles and patroclus achilles tending patroclus wounded by an arrow attic red figure kylix bc altes museum berlin the exact nature of achilles relationship with patroclus has been subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times in the iliad it appears to be the model of deep and loyal friendship homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus were lovers although there is no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures in th century bc athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia in plato symposium the participants in dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were couple phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover but ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to achilles and patroclus to imply homosexual relationship death the death of achilles even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources is complex one with many different versions in the oldest one the iliad and as predicted by hector with his dying breath the hero death was brought about by paris with an arrow to the heel according to statius in some versions the god apollo guided paris arrow some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with poisoned arrow all of these versions deny paris any sort of valour owing to the common conception that paris was coward and not the man his brother hector was and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield his bones were mingled with those of patroclus and funeral games were held he was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube dying achilles achilleas thniskon in the gardens of the achilleion another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses polyxena achilles asks priam for polyxena hand in marriage priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world greatest warrior but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles paris who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with divine arrow killing him in the odyssey agamemnon informs achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his mound at the hellespont while they are receiving the dead suitors in hades he claims they built massive burial mound on the beach of ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patroclus paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles in book of homer odyssey odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead but achilles then asks odysseus of his son exploits in the trojan war and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus heroic actions achilles is filled with satisfaction this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life according to some accounts he had married medea in life so that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica rd century bc fate of achilles armour attic black figure lekythos from sicily bc staatliche munich achilles armour was the object of feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ajax the greater they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners who after considering both men presentations decided odysseus was more deserving of the armour furious ajax cursed odysseus which earned him the ire of athena who temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades after while when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep he was so ashamed that he committed suicide odysseus eventually gave the armour to neoptolemus the son of achilles when odysseus encounters the shade of ajax much later in the house of hades odyssey ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to odysseus relic claimed to be achilles bronze headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis lycia port on the pamphylian gulf the city was visited in bc by alexander the great who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear however it was shown in the time of pausanias in the nd century ad achilles ajax and game of petteia numerous paintings on pottery have suggested tale not mentioned in the literary traditions at some point in the war achilles and ajax were playing board game petteia they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle the trojans attacked and reached the heroes who were saved only by an intervention of athena worship and heroic cult tripod in front on the polyxena sarcophagus circa bc roman statue of man with the dead body of boy identified as achilles and troilus nd century ad naples national archaeological museum the tomb of achilles extant throughout antiquity in troad was venerated by thessalians but also by persian expeditionary forces as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla achilles cult was also to be found at other places on the island of astypalaea in the sporades in sparta which had sanctuary in elis and in achilles homeland thessaly as well as in the magna graecia cities of tarentum locri and croton accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero the cult of achilles is illustrated in the bc polyxena sarcophagus where the sacrifice of polixena near the tumulus of achilles is depicted strabo also suggested that such cult of achilles existed in troad the spread and intensity of the hero veneration among the greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus today black sea appears to have been remarkable an archaic cult is attested for the milesian colony of olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea today identified with snake island ukrainian зміїний zmiinyi near kiliya ukraine early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea graffiti and inscribed clay disks these possibly being votive offerings from olbia the area of berezan island and the tauric chersonese attest the existence of heroic cult of achilles from the sixth century bc onwards the cult was still thriving in the third century ad when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an achilles pontárchēs ποντάρχης roughly lord of the sea or of the pontus euxinus who was invoked as protector of the city of olbia venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates hermes agoraeus or poseidon pliny the elder ad in his natural history mentions port of the achæi and an island of achilles famous for the tomb of that man portus achaeorum insula achillis tumulo eius viri clara situated somewhat nearby olbia and the dnieper bug estuary furthermore at roman miles from this island he places peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of sword obliquely called dromos achilleos ἀχιλλέως δρόμος achilléōs drómos the race course of achilles and considered the place of the hero exercise or of games instituted by him this last feature of pliny account is considered to be the iconic spit called today tendra or kosa tendra and kosa djarilgatch situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay but which is hardly roman miles km away from the dnieper bug estuary as pliny states to the race course he gives length of miles km whereas the spit measures km today in the following chapter of his book pliny refers to the same island as achillea and introduces two further names for it leuce or macaron from greek νῆσος μακαρῶν island of the blest the present day measures he gives at this point seem to account for an identification of achillea or leuce with today snake island pliny contemporary pomponius mela ad tells that achilles was buried on an island named achillea situated between the borysthenes and the ister adding to the geographical confusion ruins of square temple measuring meters to side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly in on snake island second exploration in showed that the construction of lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple fifth century bc black glazed lekythos inscription found on the island in reads glaukos son of poseidon dedicated me to achilles lord of leuke in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc statue is dedicated to achilles lord of leuke by citizen of olbia while in further dedication the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island cult again suggesting its quality as place of supra regional hero veneration the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic aethiopis according to which after his untimely death thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to mythical λεύκη νῆσος leúkē nêsos white island already in the fifth century bc pindar had mentioned cult of achilles on bright island φαεννά νᾶσος phaenná nâsos of the black sea while in another of his works pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmus well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles μακαρῶν νῆσοι makárôn nêsoi or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in poem by alcaeus speaking of achilles lord of scythia and the opposition of north and south as evoked by achilles fight against the aethiopian prince memnon who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death the periplus of the euxine sea ad gives the following details the greek geographer dionysius periegetes who lived probably during the first century ad wrote that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour similarly others relate the island name to its white cliffs snakes or birds dwelling there pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame in this island there is also achilles temple and his statue leuce had also reputation as place of healing pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent lord of croton to be cured of chest wound ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles herodotus pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of town achílleion ἀχίλλειον built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc close to the hero presumed burial mound in the troad later attestations point to an achílleion in messenia according to stephanus byzantinus and an achílleios ἀχίλλειος in laconia nicolae densuşianu recognized connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta called chilia presumably from an older achileii though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea evokes modern rather than archaic sea law the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son neoptolemus alexander the great son of the epirote princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy in ad the roman emperor caracalla while on his way to war against parthia emulated alexander by holding games around achilles tumulus reception during antiquity in greek tragedy the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce workable modern play the first part of the achilleis trilogy the myrmidons focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon only few lines survive today in plato symposium phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles play with achilles as the main character only few fragments survive towards the end of the th century bc more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama euripides refers to achilles in bitter or ironic tone in hecuba electra and iphigenia in aulis in greek philosophy the philosopher zeno of elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swift footed achilles and tortoise by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to tortoise with head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible as student of the monist parmenides and member of the eleatic school zeno believed time and motion to be illusions achilles in roman and medieval literature the romans who traditionally traced their lineage to troy took highly negative view of achilles virgil refers to achilles as savage and merciless butcher of men while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children other writers such as catullus propertius and ovid represent second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on achilles erotic career this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in benoît de sainte maure roman de troie and guido delle colonne historia destructionis troiae which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the th century achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler leo the deacon not as hellene but as scythian while according to the byzantine author john malalas his

spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil the resolution was ignored in both congress and the national papers and it cost lincoln political support in his district

almanac showing the moon was at low angle drastically reducing visibility armstrong was acquitted leading up to his presidential campaign lincoln elevated his profile in an murder case with his defense of simeon quinn peachy harrison who was third cousin harrison was also the grandson of lincoln political opponent rev peter cartwright harrison was charged with the murder of greek crafton who as he lay dying of his wounds confessed to cartwright that he had provoked harrison lincoln angrily protested the judge initial decision to exclude cartwright testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay lincoln argued that the testimony involved dying declaration and was not subject to the hearsay rule instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as expected the judge democrat reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence resulting in harrison acquittal republican politics emergence as republican leader his debates with stephen douglas over slavery the debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave holding south and the free north with the failure of the compromise of legislative package designed to address the issue in his eulogy for clay lincoln highlighted the latter support for gradual emancipation and opposition to both extremes on the slavery issue as the slavery debate in the nebraska and kansas territories became particularly acrimonious illinois senator stephen douglas proposed popular sovereignty as compromise the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery the legislation alarmed many northerners who sought to prevent the resulting spread of slavery but douglas kansas nebraska act narrowly passed congress in may lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his peoria speech in october lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency he said the kansas act had declared indifference but as must think covert real zeal for the spread of slavery cannot but hate it hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world lincoln attacks on the kansas nebraska act marked his return to political life nationally the whigs were irreparably split by the kansas nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue reflecting on the demise of his party lincoln wrote in think am whig but others say there are no whigs and that am an abolitionist do no more than oppose the extension of slavery the new republican party was formed as northern party dedicated to antislavery drawing from the antislavery wing of the whig party and combining free soil liberty and antislavery democratic party members lincoln resisted early republican entreaties fearing that the new party would become platform for extreme abolitionists lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the whigs though he lamented his party growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement in lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat the year elections showed the strong opposition to the kansas nebraska act and in the aftermath lincoln sought election to the united states senate at that time senators were elected by the state legislature after leading in the first six rounds of voting he was unable to obtain majority lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull trumbull was an antislavery democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots his supporters also antislavery democrats had vowed not to support any whig lincoln decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbull antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate joel aldrich matteson campaign violent political confrontations in kansas continued and opposition to the kansas nebraska act remained strong throughout the north as the elections approached lincoln joined the republicans and attended the bloomington convention which formally established the illinois republican party the convention platform endorsed congress right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of kansas as free state lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the union at the june republican national convention though lincoln received support to run as vice president john frémont and william dayton comprised the ticket which lincoln supported throughout illinois the democrats nominated former secretary of state james buchanan and the know nothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore buchanan prevailed while republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois and lincoln became leading republican in illinois portrait of dred scott petitioner in dred scott sandford dred scott sandford dred scott was slave whose master took him from slave state to free territory under the missouri compromise after scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned federal court for his freedom his petition was denied in dred scott sandford supreme court chief justice roger taney in the decision wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories the decision sparked further outrage in the north lincoln denounced it as the product of conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power he argued the decision was at variance with the declaration of independence he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect they believed all men were equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness lincoln douglas debates and cooper union speech in douglas was up for re election in the senate and lincoln hoped to defeat him many in the party felt that former whig should be nominated in and lincoln campaigning and support of trumbull had earned him favor some eastern republicans supported douglas from his opposition to the lecompton constitution and admission of kansas as slave state many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference for the first time illinois republicans held convention to agree upon senate candidate and lincoln won the nomination with little opposition abraham lincoln by mathew brady taken the day of the cooper union speech accepting the nomination lincoln delivered his house divided speech with the biblical reference mark house divided against itself cannot stand believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free do not expect the union to be dissolved do not expect the house to fall but do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other the speech created stark image of the danger of disunion the stage was then set for the election of the illinois legislature which would in turn select lincoln or douglas when informed of lincoln nomination douglas stated lincoln is the strong man of the party and if beat him my victory will be hardly won the senate campaign featured seven debates between the two these were the most famous political debates in american history they had an atmosphere akin to prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically lincoln warned that douglas slave power was threatening the values of republicanism and accused douglas of distorting the founding fathers premise that all men are created equal douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists lincoln argument assumed moral tone as he claimed douglas represented conspiracy to promote slavery douglas argument was more legal claiming that lincoln was defying the authority of the supreme court in the dred scott decision though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature re elected douglas lincoln articulation of the issues gave him national political presence in may lincoln purchased the illinois staats anzeiger german language newspaper that was consistently supportive most of the state german americans voted democratic but the german language paper mobilized republican support in the aftermath of the election newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as potential republican presidential candidate rivaled by william seward salmon chase edward bates and simon cameron while lincoln was popular in the midwest he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office in january lincoln told group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy on february powerful new york republicans invited lincoln to give speech at cooper union in which he argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery he insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly but lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention journalist noah brooks reported no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to new york audience historian david herbert donald described the speech as superb political move for an unannounced candidate to appear in one rival seward own state at an event sponsored by the second rival chase loyalists while not mentioning either by name during its delivery in response to an inquiry about his ambitions lincoln said the taste is in my mouth little

average one hundred and eighty pounds dark complexion with coarse black hair and gray eyes michael martinez wrote about the effective imaging of lincoln by his campaign at times he was presented as the plain talking rail splitter and at other times he was honest abe unpolished but trustworthy on may at the republican national convention in chicago lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot beating candidates such as seward and chase former democrat hannibal hamlin of maine was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket lincoln success depended on his campaign team his reputation as moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff pennsylvania put him over the top led by the state iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support lincoln managers had focused on this delegation while honoring lincoln dictate to make no contracts that bind me as the slave power tightened its grip on the national government most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party throughout the lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession when douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the democratic convention they opposed douglas position on popular

tennessee lincoln and douglas competed for votes in the north while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south the rail candidate lincoln candidacy is critiqued held up by slave on the left and his party on the right prior to the republican convention the lincoln campaign began cultivating nationwide youth organization the wide awakes which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties lincoln ideas of abolishing slavery grew drawing more supporters people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln and rallied supporters for lincoln as douglas and the other candidates campaigned lincoln gave no speeches relying on the enthusiasm of the republican party the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials republican speakers focused first on the party platform and second on lincoln life story emphasizing his childhood poverty the goal was to demonstrate the power of free labor which allowed common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts the republican party production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition chicago tribune writer produced pamphlet that detailed lincoln life and sold copies electoral votes shown in red put lincoln into the white house on november lincoln was elected the th president he was the first republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the north and west no ballots were cast for him in of the southern slave states and he won only two of counties in all the southern states lincoln received votes or of the total in four

constitution the upper south and border states delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas initially rejected the secessionist appeal president buchanan and president elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy declaring secession illegal the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february attempts at compromise followed but lincoln and the republicans rejected the proposed crittenden compromise as contrary to the party platform of free soil in the territories lincoln said will suffer death before consent to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have constitutional right lincoln tacitly supported the corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when lincoln took office that doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed few weeks before the war lincoln sent letter to every governor informing them congress had passed joint resolution to amend the constitution capitol building the dome above the rotunda was still under construction en route to his inauguration lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north the president elect evaded suspected assassins in baltimore on february he arrived in disguise in washington which was placed under substantial military guard lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between north and south stating one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended this is the only substantial dispute the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature the failure of the peace conference of signaled that legislative compromise was impossible by march no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms meanwhile lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated later in his second inaugural address lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came the civil war lincoln with officers after the battle of antietam notable figures from left are col delos sackett gen george morell alexander webb

anderson commander of the union fort sumter in charleston south carolina sent request for provisions to washington and lincoln order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war on april confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter and began the fight historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and overlooking southern unionist opposition to an invasion william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on volcano and that the south was preparing for war donald concludes that his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood but he also vowed not to surrender the forts the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that on april lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view remained intact despite the seceding states this call forced states to choose sides virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of richmond as the confederate capital despite its exposure to union lines north carolina tennessee and arkansas followed over the following two months secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland but did not prevail kentucky remained neutral the fort sumter attack rallied americans north of the mason dixon line to defend the nation as states sent union regiments south

arresting local maryland officials lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus where needed for the security of troops trying to reach washington john merryman one maryland official hindering the troop movements petitioned supreme court chief justice roger taney to issue writ of habeas corpus in june taney ruling only for the lower circuit court in ex parte merryman issued the writ which he felt could only be suspended by congress lincoln persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas union military strategy lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the union military strategy he responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commander in chief by exercising unprecedented authority he expanded his war powers imposed blockade on confederate ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress suspended habeas corpus and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers lincoln gained the support of congress and the northern public for these actions lincoln also had to reinforce union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict running the machine an political cartoon satirizing lincoln administration featuring william fessenden edwin stanton william seward gideon welles lincoln and others it was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery on august lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederates the law had little practical effect but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery in august general john frémont the republican presidential nominee without consulting washington issued martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels lincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as politically motivated and lacking military necessity as result union enlistments from maryland kentucky and missouri increased by over internationally lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the confederacy he relied on his combative secretary of state william seward while working closely with senate foreign relations committee chairman charles sumner in the trent affair which threatened war with great britain the navy illegally intercepted british mail ship the trent on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys britain protested vehemently while the cheered lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats biographer james randall dissected lincoln successful techniques lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the war department he tracked all phases of the effort consulting with governors and selecting generals based on their success their state and their party in january after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced war secretary simon cameron with edwin stanton stanton centralized the war department activities auditing and canceling contracts saving the federal government stanton was staunch unionist pro business conservative democrat who gravitated toward the radical republican faction he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together say thomas and hyman lincoln war strategy embraced two priorities ensuring that washington was well defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for prompt decisive victory twice week lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon occasionally mary prevailed on him to take carriage ride concerned that he was working too hard for his edification lincoln relied upon book by his chief of staff general henry halleck entitled elements of military art and science halleck was disciple of the european strategist antoine henri jomini lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy army rather than simply capturing territory general mcclellan after the union rout at bull run and winfield scott retirement lincoln appointed major general george mcclellan general in chief mcclellan then took months to plan his virginia peninsula campaign mcclellan slow progress frustrated lincoln as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington mcclellan in turn blamed the failure of the campaign on lincoln reservation of troops for the capitol lincoln and mcclellan in lincoln removed mcclellan for the general continued inaction he elevated henry halleck in july and appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia pope satisfied lincoln desire to advance on richmond from the north thus protecting washington from counterattack but pope was then soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of forcing the army of the potomac back to defend washington despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan failure to reinforce pope lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington two days after mcclellan return to command general robert lee forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam that battle union victory was among the bloodiest in american history it facilitated lincoln emancipation proclamation in january mcclellan then resisted the president demand that he pursue lee withdrawing army while general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with ambrose burnside the appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on lincoln part burnside against presidential advice launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december desertions during came in the thousands and only increased after fredericksburg so lincoln replaced burnside with joseph hooker in the midterm elections the republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation high taxes rumors of corruption suspension of habeas corpus military draft law and fears that freed slaves would come north and undermine the labor market the emancipation proclamation gained votes for republicans in rural new england and the upper midwest but cost votes in the irish and german strongholds and in the lower midwest where many southerners had lived for generations in the spring of lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near the plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond rosecrans on chattanooga grant on vicksburg and naval assault on charleston hooker was routed by lee at the battle of in may then resigned and was replaced by george

abolition lincoln rejected fremont two emancipation attempts in august as well as one by major general david hunter in may on the grounds that it was not within their power and would upset loyal border states in june congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory which lincoln signed in july the confiscation act of was enacted providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was he felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commander in chief which he planned to exercise lincoln at this time reviewed draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet privately lincoln concluded that the confederacy slave base had to be eliminated copperheads argued that emancipation was stumbling block to peace and reunification republican editor horace greeley of the new york tribune agreed in letter of august lincoln said that while he personally wished all men could be free regardless of that his first obligation as president was to preserve the union the emancipation proclamation issued on september and effective january affirmed the freedom of slaves in states not then under union control with exemptions specified for areas under such control lincoln comment on signing the proclamation was never in my life felt more certain that was doing right than do in signing this paper he spent the next days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites with the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now military objective union armies advancing south liberated three million slaves enlisting former slaves became official policy by the spring of lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers in letter to tennessee military governor andrew johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops

electoral landslide for lincoln in red in the election southern states brown and territories gray not in play lincoln ran for reelection in while uniting the main republican factions along with war democrats edwin stanton and andrew johnson lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers greatly expanded from peacetime to build support and fend off the radicals efforts to replace him at its convention the republicans selected johnson as his running mate to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans lincoln ran under the label of the new union party grant bloody stalemates damaged lincoln re election prospects and many republicans feared defeat lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope the pledge read as follows the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war failure but their candidate mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform meanwhile lincoln emboldened grant with more troops and republican party support

historian mark noll places the speech among the small handful of semi sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world it is inscribed in the lincoln memorial lincoln said reconstruction reconstruction preceded the war end as lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation and the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves when general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates were to be treated lincoln replied let em up easy lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states his main goal was to keep the union together so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame but on how to rebuild the nation as one lincoln led the moderates in reconstruction policy

promote plan that would reestablish statehood when percent of the voters agreed and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery democratic opponents accused lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the wade davis bill which lincoln vetoed the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from louisiana arkansas and tennessee lincoln appointments were designed to harness both moderates and radicals to fill chief justice taney seat on the supreme court he named the radicals choice salmon chase who lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies after implementing the emancipation proclamation lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with constitutional amendment he declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter and by december an amendment was brought to congress

years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen lincoln announced reconstruction plan that involved short term military control pending readmission under the control of southern unionists

eric foner argues that native american policy lincoln experience with indians followed the death of his grandfather abraham at their hands in the presence of his father and uncles lincoln claimed indians were antagonistic toward his father thomas lincoln and his young family although lincoln was veteran of the black hawk war which was fought in wisconsin and illinois in he saw no significant action during his presidency lincoln policy toward indians was driven by politics he used the indian bureau as source of patronage making appointments to his loyal followers in minnesota and wisconsin he faced difficulties guarding western settlers railroads and telegraphs from indian attacks on august the sioux uprising in minnesota supported by the yankton indians killed hundreds of white settlers forced from their homes and deeply alarmed the lincoln administration some believed it was conspiracy by the confederacy to launch war on the northwestern front lincoln sent general john pope

indians lincoln responded could not afford to hang men for votes other enactments in the selection and use of his cabinet lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in manner that emboldened his presidency lincoln commented on his thought process we need the strongest men of the party in the cabinet we needed to hold our own people together had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men then had no right to deprive the country of their services goodwin described the group in her biography as team of rivals lincoln adhered to the whig theory of presidency

pacific railway acts of and granted federal support for the construction of the united states first railroad which was completed in the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was enabled by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the there were two measures passed to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs policy with long precedent and federal income tax in lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariffs following the first enacted by buchanan he also signed the revenue act of creating the first income tax flat tax of percent on incomes above in current dollar terms the revenue act of adopted rates that increased with income lincoln presided over the expansion of the federal government economic influence in

todd lincoln clara harris and henry rathbone john wilkes booth was well known actor and confederate spy from maryland though he never joined the confederate army he had contacts with the confederate secret service after attending an april speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks booth hatched plot to assassinate the president when booth learned of the lincolns intent to attend play with general grant he planned to assassinate lincoln and grant at ford theatre lincoln and his wife attended the play our american cousin on the evening of april just five days after the union victory at the battle of appomattox courthouse at the last minute grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play at pm booth entered the back of lincoln theater box crept up from behind and fired at the back of lincoln head mortally wounding him lincoln guest major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth but booth stabbed him and escaped after being attended by doctor charles leale and two other doctors lincoln was taken across the street to petersen house after remaining in coma for eight hours lincoln died at am on april stanton saluted and

the next morning two weeks later booth was tracked to farm in virginia and refusing to surrender he was mortally shot by sergeant boston corbett and died on april secretary of war stanton had issued orders that booth be taken alive so corbett was initially arrested for court martial after brief interview stanton declared him patriot and dismissed the charge funeral and burial the late president lay in state first in the east room of the white house and then in the capitol rotunda from april through april the caskets containing lincoln body and the body of his son willie traveled for three weeks on the lincoln special funeral train the train followed circuitous route from washington to springfield illinois stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands bonfires and hymn singing or in silent grief poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom to eulogize him one of four poems he wrote about lincoln african americans were especially moved they had lost their moses in larger sense the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow but noted that some lincoln haters celebrated his death religious and philosophical beliefs abraham lincoln painting by george peter alexander healy in as young man lincoln was religious skeptic he was deeply familiar with the bible quoting and praising it he was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others he never made clear profession of christian beliefs through his entire public career lincoln had proneness for quoting scripture his three most famous speeches the house divided speech the gettysburg address and his second inaugural each contain direct allusions to providence and quotes from scripture in the lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity belief that the human mind was controlled by higher power with the death of his son edward in he more frequently expressed dependence on god he never joined church although he frequently attended first presbyterian church with his wife beginning in in the lincoln asserted his belief in providence in general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence the death of son willie in february may have caused him to look toward religion for solace after willie death he questioned the divine necessity of the war severity he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without human contest yet the contest began and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day yet the contest proceeds lincoln did believe in an all powerful god that shaped events and by was expressing those beliefs in major speeches by the end of the war he increasingly appealed to the almighty for solace and to explain events writing on april to newspaper editor in kentucky claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me now at the end of three years struggle the nation condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected god alone can claim it whither it is tending seems plain if god now wills the removal of great wrong and wills also that we of the north as well as you of the south shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of god this spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in american history and by lincoln himself as his own greatest speech or one of them at the very least lincoln explains therein the cause purpose and result of the war was god will later in life lincoln frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs and might have been device to reach his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants on the day lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land health lincoln in february two months before his death lincoln is believed to have had depression smallpox and malaria he took blue mass pills which contained mercury to treat constipation it is unknown to what extent he may have suffered from mercury poisoning several claims have been made that lincoln health was declining before the assassination these are often based on photographs of lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting it is also suspected that he might have had rare genetic disease such as marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type legacy republican values lincoln redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as john patrick diggins harry jaffa vernon burton eric foner and herman belz lincoln called the declaration of independence which emphasized freedom and equality for all the sheet anchor of republicanism beginning in the he did this at time when the constitution which tolerated slavery was the focus of most political discourse diggins notes lincoln presented americans theory of history that offers profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself in the cooper union speech instead of focusing on the legality of an argument he focused on the moral basis of republicanism his position on war though was founded on legal argument regarding the constitution as essentially contract among the states and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract further it was national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state many soldiers and religious leaders from the north though felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs as whig activist lincoln was spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks infrastructure improvements and railroads in opposition to jacksonian democrats william harris found that lincoln reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism james randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders reunification of the states in lincoln first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints he said majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of free people the successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people view the country the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural these united states and other times in the singular the civil war was significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the th century historical reputation in surveys of scholars ranking presidents conducted since the top three presidents are lincoln washington and franklin delano roosevelt although the order varies between and lincoln john kennedy and ronald reagan have been the top ranked presidents in eight surveys according to gallup study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after george washington lincoln assassination left him national martyr he was viewed by abolitionists as champion of human liberty republicans linked lincoln name to their party many though not all in the south considered lincoln as man of outstanding ability historians have said he was classical liberal in the th century sense allen guelzo states that lincoln was classical liberal democrat an enemy of artificial hierarchy friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling and an american counterpart to mill cobden and bright whose portrait lincoln hung in his white house office lincoln memorial in washington schwartz argues that lincoln american reputation grew slowly from the late th century until the progressive era when he emerged as one of america most venerated heroes even among white southerners the high point came in with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington union nationalism as envisioned by lincoln helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and franklin delano roosevelt in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state an american coin portraying lincoln sociologist barry schwartz argues that in the and the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life during the great depression he argues lincoln served as means for seeing the world disappointments for making its sufferings not so

postmodernism and have diluted greatness as concept in the cold war years lincoln image shifted to symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes by the late some african american intellectuals led by lerone bennett jr rejected lincoln role as the great emancipator bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln white supremacist in he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed sending freed slaves to another country defenders such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation by the lincoln had become hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers lincoln became favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across the world historian barry schwartz wrote in that lincoln image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late th century on the other hand donald opined in his biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason in the st

aristotle aristotélēs bc was greek philosopher and polymath during the classical period in ancient greece taught by plato he was the founder of the lyceum the peripatetic school of philosophy and the aristotelian tradition his writings cover many subjects including physics biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetry theatre music rhetoric psychology linguistics economics politics and government aristotle provided complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him it was above all from his teachings that the west inherited its intellectual lexicon as well as problems and methods of inquiry as result his philosophy has exerted unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the west and it continues to be subject of contemporary philosophical discussion little is known about his life aristotle was born in the city of stagira in northern greece his father nicomachus died when aristotle was child and he was brought up by guardian at seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined plato academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven bc shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip ii of macedon tutored alexander the great beginning in bc he established library in the lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication only around third of his original output has survived none of it intended for publication aristotle views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed some of aristotle zoological observations found in his biology such as on the hectocotyl reproductive arm of the octopus were disbelieved until the th century his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and john buridan aristotle influence on logic also continued well into the th century he influenced islamic thought during the middle ages as well as christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as the first teacher and among medieval christians like thomas aquinas as simply the philosopher his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics such as in the thinking of alasdair macintyre and philippa foot life mieza macedonia greece in general the details of aristotle life are not well established the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on few salient points aristotle whose name means the best purpose in ancient greek was born in bc in stagira chalcidice about km miles east of modern day thessaloniki his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon both of aristotle parents died when he was about thirteen and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian although little information about aristotle childhood has survived he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato academy he probably experienced the eleusinian mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the eleusinian mysteries to experience is to learn παθείν μαθεĩν aristotle remained in athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in bc the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academy direction after control passed to plato nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared the anti macedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor after the death of hermias aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon while in lesbos aristotle married pythias either hermias adoptive daughter or niece she bore him daughter whom they also named pythias in bc aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander portrait bust of aristotle an imperial roman st or nd century ad copy of lost bronze sculpture made by lysippos aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon during aristotle time in the macedonian court he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and aristotle own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric in one famous example he counsels alexander to be leader to the greeks and despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants by bc aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him son whom he named after his father nicomachus according to the suda he also had an erômenos palaephatus of abydus this period in athens between and bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics on the soul and poetics aristotle studied and made significant contributions to logic metaphysics mathematics physics biology botany ethics politics agriculture medicine dance and theatre near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander relationship with persia and persians widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing role in alexander death but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death following alexander death anti macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled in bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mother family estate in chalcis on euboea at which occasion he was said to have stated will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy reference to athens trial and execution of socrates he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife speculative philosophy logic with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until th century advances in mathematical logic kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion organon one of aristotle types of syllogism in words in terms in equations all men are mortal all greeks are men all greeks are mortal ps ms px what we today call aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism methods of logical argument aristotle himself would have labelled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotle work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into set of six books called the organon around bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers the books are categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutations plato left and aristotle in raphael fresco the school of athens aristotle holds his nicomachean ethics and gestures to the earth representing his view in immanent realism whilst plato gestures to the heavens indicating his theory of forms and holds his timaeus the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle writings it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning the rhetoric is not conventionally included but it states that it relies on the topics metaphysics the word metaphysics appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotle works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics aristotle called it first philosophy and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science physics as the contemplative theoretikē philosophy which is theological and studies the divine he wrote in his metaphysics substance aristotle examines the concepts of substance ousia and essence to ti ên einai the what it was to be in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that particular substance is combination of both matter and form philosophical theory called hylomorphism in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed for example the matter of house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia that let us define something as house the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form immanent realism plato forms exist as universals like the ideal form of an apple for aristotle both matter and form belong to the individual thing hylomorphism like his teacher plato aristotle philosophy aims at the universal aristotle ontology places the universal katholou in particulars kath hekaston things in the world whereas for plato the universal is separately existing form which actual things imitate for aristotle form is still what phenomena are based on but is instantiated in particular substance plato argued that all things have universal form which could be either property or relation to other things when we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyse form of an apple in this distinction there is particular apple and universal form of an apple moreover we can place an apple next to book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not part of particular things for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still proper universal form aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals where plato spoke of the world of forms place where all universal forms subsist aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms potentiality and actuality with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption he distinguishes the coming to be from growth and diminution which is change in quantity locomotion which is change in space and alteration which is change in quality the potential made actual by learning the coming to be is change where nothing persists of which the resultant is property in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form referring to potentiality this is what thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else for example the seed of plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if it is not prevented by something it will become plant potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise acting actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when plant does one of the activities that plants do in summary the matter used to make house has potentiality to be house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also final cause or end then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality with this definition of the particular substance matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man unity however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same epistemology aristotle immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world and rises to knowledge of the universal whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction whereas plato relies on deduction from priori principles natural philosophy aristotle natural philosophy spans wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics biology and other natural sciences in aristotle terminology natural philosophy is branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences aristotle work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science note however that his use of the term science carries different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics his practical science includes ethics and politics his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry his theoretical science covers physics mathematics and metaphysics physics the four classical elements fire air water earth of empedocles and aristotle illustrated with burning log the log releases all four elements as it is destroyed five elements in his on generation and corruption aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by empedocles earth water air and fire to two of the four sensible qualities hot cold wet and dry in the empedoclean scheme all matter was made of the four elements in differing proportions aristotle scheme added the heavenly aether the divine substance of the heavenly spheres stars and planets aristotle elements element motion modern stateof matter earth down solid water down liquid air up gas fire up plasma aether divinesubstance circular in heavens motion aristotle describes two kinds of motion violent or unnatural motion such as that of thrown stone in the physics and natural motion such as of falling object in on the heavens in violent motion as soon as the agent stops causing it the motion stops also in other words the natural state of an object is to be at rest since aristotle does not address friction with this understanding it can be observed that as aristotle stated heavy objects on the ground say require more force to make them move and objects pushed with greater force move faster this would imply the equation incorrect in modern physics natural motion depends on the element concerned the aether naturally moves in circle around the heavens while the empedoclean elements move vertically up like fire as is observed or down like earth towards their natural resting places physics he states that objects fall at speed proportional to their weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid they are immersed in this is correct approximation for objects in earth gravitational field moving in air or water in the physics aristotle effectively states quantitative law that the speed of falling body is proportional say with constant to its weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid in which it is falling aristotle implies that in vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite and concludes from this apparent absurdity that vacuum is not possible opinions have varied on whether aristotle intended to state quantitative laws henri carteron held the extreme view that aristotle concept of force was basically qualitative but other authors reject this archimedes corrected aristotle theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places metal boats can float if they displace enough water floating depends in archimedes scheme on the mass and volume of the object not as aristotle thought its elementary composition aristotle writings on motion remained influential until the early modern period john philoponus in the middle ages and galileo are said to have shown by experiment that aristotle claim that heavier object falls faster than lighter object is incorrect contrary opinion is given by carlo rovelli who argues that aristotle physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity that of objects in the earth gravitational field immersed in fluid such as air in this system heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones whether friction is ignored or not and they do fall more slowly in denser medium newton forced motion corresponds to aristotle violent motion with its external agent but aristotle assumption that the agent effect stops immediately it stops acting the ball leaves the thrower hand has awkward consequences he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it resulting in the medieval theory of impetus four causes aristotle argued by analogy with woodwork that thing takes its form from four causes in the case of table the wood used material cause its design formal cause the tools and techniques used efficient cause and its decorative or practical purpose final cause aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors his term aitia is traditionally translated as cause but it does not always refer to temporal sequence it might be better translated as explanation but the traditional rendering will be employed here material cause describes the material out of which something is composed thus the material cause of table is wood it is not about action it does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino the formal cause is its form the arrangement of that matter it tells us what thing is that thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole macrostructure is the cause of its parts relationship known as the whole part causation plainly put the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist architect or engineer to create drawing the efficient cause is the primary source or that from which the change under consideration proceeds it identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs in the case of two dominoes when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over in the case of animals this agency is combination of how it develops from the egg and how its body functions the final cause telos is its purpose the reason why thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities the final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve this covers modern ideas of motivating causes such as volition in the case of living things it implies adaptation to particular way of life optics aristotle describes experiments in optics using camera obscura in problems book the apparatus consisted of dark chamber with small aperture that let light in with it he saw that whatever shape he made the hole the sun image always remained circular he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image chance and spontaneity according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things from what is spontaneous there is also more specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that only applies to people moral choices astronomy in astronomy aristotle refuted democritus claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun rays pointing out correctly that if the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them aristotle noted that the ground level of the aeolian islands changed before volcanic eruption geology aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations he stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one person lifetime the geologist charles lyell noted that aristotle described such change including lakes that had dried up and deserts that had become watered by rivers giving as examples the growth of the nile delta since the time of homer and the upheaving of one of the aeolian islands previous to volcanic eruption biology hectocotyl arm of the octopus bottom left empirical research aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically and biology forms large part of his writings he spent two years observing and describing the zoology of lesbos and the surrounding seas including in particular the pyrrha lagoon in the centre of lesbos his data in history of animals generation of animals movement of animals and parts of animals are assembled from his own observations statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas his apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is historical accident his works on botany have been lost but two books on plants by his pupil theophrastus have survived aristotle reports on the sea life visible from observation on lesbos and the catches of fishermen he describes the catfish electric ray and frogfish in detail as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus his description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until the th century he gives accurate descriptions of the four chambered fore stomachs of ruminants and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark he notes that an animal structure is well matched to function so among birds the heron which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish has long neck and long legs and sharp spear like beak whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet darwin too noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal but unlike aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution aristotle writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution but while aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur he saw these as rare accidents for aristotle accidents like heat waves in winter must be considered distinct from natural causes he was thus critical of empedocles materialist theory of survival of the fittest origin of living things and their organs and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results to put his views into modern terms he nowhere says that different species can have common ancestor or that one kind can change into another or that kinds can become extinct scientific style aristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals including that brood size decreases with body mass whereas gestation period increases he was correct in these predictions at least for mammals data are shown for mouse and elephant aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense he used the ancient greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations or at most investigative procedures like dissection in generation of animals he finds fertilized hen egg of suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo heart beating inside instead he practiced different style of science systematically gathering data discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals and inferring possible causal explanations from these this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in new field such as genomics it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs narrative explanation of what is observed in this sense aristotle biology is scientific from the data he collected and documented aristotle inferred quite number of rules relating the life history features of the live bearing tetrapods terrestrial placental mammals that he studied among these correct predictions are the following brood size decreases with adult body mass so that an elephant has fewer young usually just one per brood than mouse lifespan increases with gestation period and also with body mass so that elephants live longer than mice have longer period of gestation and are heavier as final example fecundity decreases with lifespan so long lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short lived kinds like mice classification of living things aristotle recorded that the embryo of dogfish was attached by cord to kind of placenta the yolk sac like higher animal this formed an exception to the linear scale from highest to lowest aristotle distinguished about species of animals arranging these in the history of animals in graded scale of perfection scala naturae with man at the top his system had eleven grades of animal from highest potential to lowest expressed in their form at birth the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures the lowest laid cold dry mineral like eggs animals came above plants and these in turn were above minerals see also he grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter animals with blood and below them the colder invertebrates as animals without blood those with blood were divided into the live bearing mammals and the egg laying birds reptiles fish those without blood were insects crustacea non shelled cephalopods and shelled and the hard shelled molluscs bivalves and gastropods he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into linear scale and noted various exceptions such as that sharks had placenta like the tetrapods to modern biologist the explanation not available to aristotle is convergent evolution he believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design aristotle scala naturae highest to lowest group examples given by aristotle blood legs souls rational sensitive vegetative qualities man man with blood legs live bearing tetrapods cat hare with blood legs cetaceans dolphin whale with blood none birds bee eater nightjar with blood legs except eggs egg laying tetrapods chameleon crocodile with blood legs except scales eggs snakes water snake ottoman viper with blood none except scales eggs egg laying fishes sea bass parrotfish with blood none including eggs among the egg laying fishes placental selachians shark skate with blood none but placenta like tetrapods crustaceans shrimp crab without many legs except shell cephalopods squid octopus without tentacles hard shelled animals cockle trumpet snail without none mineral shell larva bearing insects ant cicada without legs spontaneously generating sponges worms without none or from earth plants fig without none minerals iron without none none psychology soul structure for souls of plants animals and humans making humans unique in having all three types of soul aristotle psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psychēs posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul humans have rational soul the human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous intellect and logos reason for aristotle the soul is the form of living being because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians he placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain notable is aristotle division of sensation and thought which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon memory according to aristotle in on the soul memory is the ability to hold perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past in other words memory is mental picture phantasm that can be recovered aristotle believed an impression is left on semi fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make memory memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation aristotelian common sense and thinking aristotle uses the term memory for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at particular time and processing specific contents memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences both for our previous experience and present experience because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences to search for these impressions people search the memory itself within the memory if one experience is offered instead of specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the next when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed recollection is thus the self directed activity of retrieving the information stored in memory impression only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity such as numbers and words animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed senses perception memory dreams action in aristotle psychology impressions are stored in the sensorium the heart linked by his laws of association similarity contrast and contiguity aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain impressions was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity contrast and contiguity described in his laws of association aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience according to aristotle association is the power innate in mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled dreams aristotle describes sleep in on sleep and wakefulness sleep takes place as result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body while person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness since person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire which is the result of sensation however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently unless they are weary dreams do not involve actually sensing stimulus in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner aristotle explains that when person stares at moving stimulus such as the waves in body of water and then look away the next thing they look at appears to have wavelike motion when person perceives stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored however during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences so dreams result from these lasting impressions since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience during sleep person is in an altered state of mind aristotle compares sleeping person to person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward stimulus for example person who has strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings since person sleeping is in suggestible state and unable to make judgements they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams like the infatuated person this leads the person to believe the dream is real even when the dreams are absurd in nature in de anima iii aristotle ascribes the ability to create to store and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination phantasia one component of aristotle theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by divine being aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences aristotle claimed that dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it if person had an image appear for moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered dream because they were awake when it occurred secondly any sensory experience that is perceived while person is asleep does not qualify as part of dream for example if while person is sleeping door shuts and in their dream they hear door is shut this sensory experience is not part of the dream lastly the images of dreams must be result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences practical philosophy aristotle practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics politics economics and rhetoric virtues and their accompanying vices too little virtuous mean too much humbleness high mindedness vainglory lack of purpose right ambition over ambition spiritlessness good temper irascibility rudeness civility obsequiousness cowardice courage rashness insensibility self control intemperance sarcasm sincerity boastfulness boorishness wit buffoonery shamelessness modesty shyness callousness just resentment spitefulness pettiness generosity vulgarity meanness liberality wastefulness just war theory aristotelian just war theory is not well regarded in the present day especially his view that warfare was justified to enslave natural slaves in aristotelian philosophy the abolition of what he considers natural slavery would undermine civic freedom the pursuit of freedom is inseparable from pursuing mastery over those who deserve to be slaves according to the cambridge companion to aristotle politics the targets of this aggressive warfare were non greeks noting aristotle view that our poets say it is proper for greeks to rule non greeks aristotle generally has favourable opinion of war extolling it as chance for virtue and writing that the leisure that accompanies peace tends to make people arrogant war to avoid becoming enslaved to others is justified as self defense he writes that war compels people to be just and temperate however in order to be just war must be chosen for the sake of peace with the exception of wars of aggression discussed above ethics aristotle considered ethics to be practical rather than theoretical study one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of thing an eye is only good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight aristotle reasoned that humans must have function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē soul in accordance with reason logos aristotle identified such an optimum activity the virtuous mean between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires good character ēthikē aretē often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence aristotle taught that to achieve virtuous and potentially happy character requires first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words philosopher politics in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics aristotle considered the city to be natural community moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part he famously stated that man is by nature political animal and argued that humanity defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like machine and as collection of parts none of which can exist without the others aristotle conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner aristotle classifications of political constitutions the common modern understanding of political community as modern state is quite different from aristotle understanding although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as political community or partnership koinōnia the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences in protrepticus the character aristotle states economics aristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought especially to thought in the middle ages in politics aristotle addresses the city property and trade his response to criticisms of private property in lionel robbins view anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society and that although private property is often blamed for social strife such evils in fact come from human nature in politics aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money money came into use because people became dependent on one another importing what they needed and exporting the surplus for the sake of convenience people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable such as iron or silver aristotle discussions on retail and interest was major influence on economic thought in the middle ages he had low opinion of retail believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household retail trade seeks to make profit it thus uses goods as means to an end rather than as an end unto itself he believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural similarly aristotle considered making profit through interest unnatural as it makes gain out of the money itself and not from its use aristotle gave summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time he wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through count of the number of other goods it is worth the necessity arises of single universal standard of measurement money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them commensurable he goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange making it sort of security that is if we do not want thing now we shall be able to get it when we do want it rhetoric and poetics the blind oedipus commending his children to the gods by bénigne gagneraux in his poetics aristotle uses the tragedy oedipus tyrannus by sophocles as an example of how the perfect tragedy should be structured with generally good protagonist who starts the play prosperous but loses everything through some hamartia fault aristotle rhetoric proposes that speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience ethos an appeal to the speaker character pathos an appeal to the audience emotion and logos an appeal to logical reasoning he also categorizes rhetoric into three genres epideictic ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame forensic judicial speeches over guilt or innocence and deliberative speeches calling on an audience to make decision on an issue aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs enthymeme proof by syllogism and paradeigma proof by example aristotle writes in his poetics that epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry painting sculpture music and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis imitation each varying in imitation by medium object and manner he applies the term mimesis both as property of work of art and also as the product of the artist intention and contends that the audience realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself aristotle states that mimesis is natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry follows the pattern of nature because of this aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what stephen halliwell calls highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama while it is believed that aristotle poetics originally comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry the characters in tragedy are merely means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions aristotle concludes poetics with discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic aristotle was keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop views on women aristotle analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element on this ground proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism however aristotle gave equal weight to women happiness as he did to men and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men influence more than years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method taneli kukkonen writing in the classical tradition observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched and his reach in influencing every branch of intellectual enterprise including western ethical and political theory theology rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long as result kukkonen argues any analysis of reality today will almost certainly carry aristotelian overtones evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind jonathan barnes wrote that an account of aristotle intellectual afterlife would be little less than history of european thought on his successor theophrastus frontispiece to version of theophrastus historia plantarum originally written around bc aristotle pupil and successor theophrastus wrote the history of plants pioneering work in botany some of his technical terms remain in use such as carpel from carpos fruit and pericarp from pericarpion seed chamber theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than aristotle was instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned on later greek philosophers the immediate influence of aristotle work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school aristotle notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus aristotle influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter bringing with him on his expedition host of zoologists botanists and researchers he had also learned great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall surpass other men if those doctrines wherein have been trained are to be all men common property on hellenistic science after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work though interest in aristotle ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not though few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the th and th centuries ernst mayr states that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance on byzantine scholars greek christian scribes played crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century john philoponus stands out for having attempted fundamental critique of aristotle views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought philoponus questioned aristotle teaching of physics noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations after hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena on the medieval islamic world islamic portrayal of aristotle aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers alkindus greatly admired aristotle philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars and was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy on medieval europe aristotle ridden by phyllis by hans baldung with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from ad to except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after the scholastic thomas aquinas wrote his summa theologica working from moerbeke translations and calling aristotle the philosopher the demand for aristotle writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages scholars such as boethius peter abelard and john buridan worked on aristotelian logic the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having cautionary medieval tale held that aristotle advised his pupil alexander to avoid the king seductive mistress phyllis but was himself captivated by her and allowed her to ride him phyllis had secretly told alexander what to expect and he witnessed phyllis proving that woman charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher male intellect artists such as hans baldung produced series of illustrations of the popular theme the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the divine comedy dante inferno canto iv translation hell vidi maestro di color che sanno seder tra filosofica famiglia tutti lo miran tutti onor li fanno quivi vid ïo socrate platone che nnanzi li altri più presso li stanno saw the master there of those who know amid the philosophic family by all admired and by all reverenced there plato too saw and socrates who stood beside him closer than the rest on early modern scientists william harvey de motu cordis showed that the blood circulated contrary to classical era thinking in the early modern period scientists such as william harvey in england and galileo galilei in italy reacted against the theories of aristotle and other classical era thinkers like galen establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood establishing that the heart functioned as pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body heat as aristotle thought galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace aristotle physics proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight on th century thinkers the th century german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle aristotle rigidly separated action from production and argued for the deserved subservience of some people natural slaves and the natural superiority virtue arete of others it was martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition the english mathematician george boole fully accepted aristotle logic but decided to go under over and beyond it with his system of algebraic logic in his book the laws of thought this gives logic mathematical foundation with equations enables it to solve equations as well as check validity and allows it to handle wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms not just two modern rejection and rehabilitation that most enduring of romantic images aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander illustration by during the th century aristotle work was widely criticized the philosopher bertrand russell argued that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine russell called aristotle ethics repulsive and labelled his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors the dutch historian of science eduard jan dijksterhuis wrote that aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by proceeding so readily to frame theory of such general character on limited evidence from their senses in the biologist peter medawar could still state in pure seventeenth century tones that aristotle had assembled strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay imperfect observation wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility by the start of the st century however aristotle was taken more seriously kukkonen noted that in the best th century scholarship aristotle comes alive as thinker wrestling with the full weight of the greek philosophical tradition ayn rand accredited aristotle as the greatest philosopher in history and cited him as major influence on her thinking more recently alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in way that is anti elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans kukkonen observed too that that most enduring of romantic images aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander remained current as in the film alexander while the firm rules of aristotle theory of drama have ensured role for the poetics in hollywood biologists continue to be interested in aristotle thinking armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotle biology while niko tinbergen four questions based on aristotle four causes are used to analyse animal behaviour they examine function phylogeny mechanism and ontogeny surviving works corpus aristotelicum first page of edition of the nicomachean ethics in greek and latin the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum these texts as opposed to aristotle lost works are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotle school reference to them is made according to the organization of immanuel bekker royal prussian academy edition aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica berlin which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works loss and preservation aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls the common writing medium of that era his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric intended for the public and the esoteric for use within the lyceum school aristotle lost works stray considerably in from the surviving aristotelian corpus whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with view to subsequent publication the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication cicero description of aristotle literary style as river of gold must have applied to the published works not the surviving notes major question in the history of aristotle works is how the exoteric writings were all lost and how the ones we now possess came to us the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today legacy depictions paintings aristotle has been depicted by major artists including lucas cranach the elder justus van gent

an american in paris is jazz influenced orchestral piece by american composer george gershwin first performed in it was inspired by the time that gershwin had spent in paris and evokes the sights and energy of the french capital in the walter damrosch had asked gershwin to write full concerto following the success of rhapsody in blue gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophones and automobile horns he brought back four parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition which took place on december in carnegie hall with damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic he completed the orchestration on november less than four weeks before the work premiere he collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer deems taylor background although the story is likely apocryphal gershwin is said to have been attracted by maurice ravel unusual chords and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in ready to study with ravel after his initial student audition with ravel turned into sharing of musical theories ravel said he could not teach him saying why be second rate ravel when you can be first rate gershwin that trip however resulted in snippet of melody entitled very parisienne that the initial musical motive of an american in paris written as thank you note to gershwin hosts robert and mabel schirmer gershwin called it rhapsodic ballet it is written freely and in much more modern idiom than his prior works gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for tour to this end upon his return to new york gershwin joined the efforts of ravel friend robert schmitz pianist ravel had met during the war to urge ravel to tour the schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting franco american musical relations and was able to offer ravel fee for the tour an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel gershwin greeted ravel in new york in march during party held for ravel birthday by éva gauthier ravel tour reignited gershwin desire to return to paris which he and his brother ira did after meeting ravel ravel high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to nadia boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris yet after he played for her she told him she could not teach him boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students what could give you that you haven already got this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete new work based on paris and perhaps second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound yeats ernest hemingway and artist pablo picasso composition gershwin based an american in paris on melodic fragment called very parisienne written in on his first visit to paris as gift to his hosts robert and mabel schirmer he described the piece as rhapsodic ballet because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works gershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere the piece is structured into five sections which culminate in loose aba format gershwin first episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops third theme in the subito con brio the style of this section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six this section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe english horn and taxi horns the section andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in faster twelve bar blues in the section gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum moderato con grazia is the last section that returns to the themes set in after recapitulating the walking themes gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section in the final grandioso response gershwin did not particularly like walter damrosch interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris he stated that damrosch sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during matinee performance of this work the audience according to edward cushing responded with demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than his concerto in some did not think it belonged in program with classical composers césar franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere gershwin responded to the critics it not beethoven symphony you know it humorous piece nothing solemn about it it not intended to draw tears if it pleases symphony audiences as light jolly piece series of impressions musically expressed it succeeds instrumentation an american in paris was originally scored for flutes rd doubling on piccolo oboes english horn clarinets in flat bass clarinet in flat bassoons contrabassoon horns in trumpets in flat trombones tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block ratchet cymbals low and high tom toms xylophone glockenspiel celesta taxi horns labeled as and with circles around them alto saxophone tenor saxophone baritone saxophone all saxophones doubling soprano saxophones and strings although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes and it has recently come to light that gershwin intention was to have used the notes and it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as and with circles he was referring to the four horns and not the notes that they played major revision of the work by composer and arranger campbell watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments alto tenor and baritone the soprano saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments and the contrabassoon was also deleted this became the standard performing edition until when gershwin specialist jack gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of an american in paris working directly from gershwin original manuscript including the restoration of gershwin soprano saxophone parts removed in campbell watson revision gibbons restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at london queen elizabeth hall on july by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian william daly arranged the score for piano solo this was published by new world music in preservation status on september it was announced that musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score would be eventually released the gershwin family working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan were working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwin true intent it was unknown if the critical score would include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster bar blues section or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during gershwin composition process the score to an american in paris was scheduled to be issued first in series of scores to be released the entire project was expected take to years to complete but an american in paris was planned to be an early volume in the series two urtext editions of the work were published by the german publisher note music in the changes made by campbell watson were withdrawn in both editions in the extended urtext bars of music were re integrated conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance on september the cincinnati symphony orchestra gave the world premiere of the long awaited critical edition of the piece prepared by mark clague director of the gershwin initiative at the university of michigan this performance was of the original orchestration except that it upheld the deletion of the contrabassoon part an alteration usually attributed to campbell watson recordings first recording an american in paris has been frequently recorded the first recording was made for the victor talking machine company in with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio then little later shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes flat flat higher and lower the radio broadcast of the september hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert in which an american in paris also conducted by shilkret was second on the program was recorded and was released in in two cd set arthur fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor including one of the first stereo recordings of the music in arturo toscanini conducting the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the piece for rca victor one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer the seattle symphony also recorded version in of gershwin original score before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today harry james released version of the blues section on his album one night stand recorded live at the aragon ballroom in chicago columbia gl and cl use in film in metro goldwyn mayer released the musical film an american in paris featuring gene kelly and leslie caron winning the best picture oscar and numerous other

an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the academy voting membership the various category winners are awarded copy of golden statuette officially called the academy award of merit although more commonly referred to by its nickname the oscar the statuette depicts knight rendered in the art deco style the award was originally sculpted by george stanley from design sketch by cedric gibbons ampas first presented it in at private dinner hosted by douglas fairbanks in the hollywood roosevelt hotel in what would become known as the st academy awards the academy awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in and was televised for the first time in it is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now televised live worldwide it is also the oldest of the four major annual american entertainment awards its equivalents the emmy awards for television the tony awards for theater and the grammy awards for music are modeled after the academy awards they are widely cited as the most famous and prestigious competitive awards in the field of entertainment the nd academy awards ceremony honoring the best films of was held on february as with the previous ceremony there was no host the ceremony was broadcast on abc it took place at the dolby theatre in los angeles california for the th consecutive year this ceremony marked the first time in oscar history that more than three films had received ten or more nominations total of oscar statuettes have been awarded since its inception in history the first academy awards presentation was held on may at private dinner function at the hollywood roosevelt hotel with an audience of about people the post awards party was held at the mayfair hotel the cost of guest tickets for that night ceremony was in dollars fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other participants in the film making industry of the time for their works during the period the ceremony ran for minutes winners were announced to media three months earlier that was changed for the second ceremony in since then for the rest of the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at pm on the night of the awards this method was used until when the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began as result the academy has since used sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners milestones the first best actor awarded was emil jannings for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh he had to return to europe before the ceremony so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first academy award winner in history at that time winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in certain category during the qualifying period for example jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and janet gaynor later won single oscar for performances in three films with the fourth ceremony however the system changed and professionals were honored for specific performance in single film for the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years at the th ceremony held in the best foreign language film category now known as best international feature film was introduced until then foreign language films had been honored with the special achievement award perhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was year old robert opel who streaked across the stage of the dorothy chandler pavilion in los angeles flashing peace sign on national us television at the th academy awards in bemused host david niven quipped isn it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings later evidence arose suggesting that opel appearance was facilitated as publicity stunt by the show producer jack haley jr robert metzler the show business manager believed that the incident had been planned in some way during the dress rehearsal niven had asked metzler wife to borrow pen so he could write down the famous line which was thus not the ad lib it appeared to be the th academy awards held in presented the first academy award for best animated feature since all academy awards ceremonies have ended with the academy award for best picture traditionally the previous year winner for best actor and best supporting actor present the awards for best actress and best supporting actress while the previous year winner for best actress and best supporting actress present the awards for best actor and best supporting actor parasite became the first foreign language film to win best picture at the february award ceremony tom hanks

years following the war the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold plated metal ones the only addition to the oscar since it was created is minor streamlining of the base the original oscar mold was cast in at the shumway sons foundry in batavia illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy award statuettes from to

epner technology the time required to produce such statuettes is roughly three months owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the academy and service existing oscars that need replating naming the academy officially adopted the name oscar for the trophies in however the origin of the nickname is disputed one biography of bette davis who was president of the academy in claims she named the award after her first husband band leader harmon oscar nelson frequently mentioned originator is margaret herrick the academy executive secretary who when she first saw the award in said the statuette reminded her of uncle oscar nickname for her cousin oscar pierce columnist sidney skolsky who was present during herrick naming in wrote that employees have affectionately dubbed

engraving to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates until winners returned their statuettes to the academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective oscars since winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription processing station at the governor ball party held immediately after the oscar ceremony the owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony bearing the name of every potential winner the nameplates for the non winning nominees are later recycled ownership of oscar statuettes prior to oscar statuettes were and remain the property of the recipient since

december in los angeles county california and play for seven consecutive days to qualify except for the best international feature film best documentary feature and awards in short film categories additionally the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run with at least one of the daily showings starting between pm and pm local time the best international feature film award does not require release it requires the film to be submitted as its country official selection the best documentary feature award requires either week long releases in both los angeles county and new york city during the previous calendar year or qualifying award at competitive film festival from the documentary feature qualifying festival list regardless of any public exhibition or distribution or submission in the international feature film category as its country official selection the qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings additionally film must have been reviewed by critic from the new york times time out new york the los angeles times or la weekly awards in short film categories best documentary short subject best animated short film and best live action short film have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards first the qualifying

the requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards only one screening per day is required for the documentary award the screening must start between noon and pm local time for other awards no specific start time is required but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times for example the best picture winner the hurt locker was actually first released in but did not qualify for the awards as it did not play its oscar qualifying run in los angeles until mid thus qualifying for the awards foreign films must include english subtitles and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the international feature film category per year rule states that film must be feature length defined as minimum of minutes except for short subject awards and it must exist either on mm or mm film print or in frame or frame progressive scan digital cinema format with minimum projector resolution of by pixels since the th academy awards presented in multi part and limited series have been ineligible for the best documentary feature award this followed the win of made in america an eight hour presentation that was screened in limited release before being broadcast in five parts on abc and espn in that category in the academy announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year the form includes the production credits for all related categories then each form is checked and put in reminder list of eligible releases in late december ballots and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around active members for most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc in the special case of best picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees in all major categories variant of the single transferable vote is used with each member casting ballot with up to five nominees ten for best picture ranked preferentially in certain categories including international feature film documentary and animated feature nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches in most categories the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members since the best picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting since re weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the best visual effects film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for movie in the running for best picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders for example producer of the best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front runner the hurt locker eventually won awards ceremonies telecast pantages theatre hollywood st academy awards presentations dolby theatre hollywood the major awards are presented at live televised ceremony commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees it is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during november or december of the previous year this is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing bow tie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast the academy awards is the world longest running awards show televised live from the to all time zones in north america and worldwide and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world the oscars were first televised in by nbc which continued to broadcast the event until when abc took over televising the festivities including the first color broadcast of the event in through nbc regained the rights for five years then abc resumed broadcast duties in and its current contract with the academy runs through the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets especially those outside of the americas in more desirable local timeslots the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since but only two south american countries chile and brazil purchased the rights to air the broadcast by that time the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in countries decade later the rights were already being sold to countries and by the tv rights to the awards were licensed in countries the ceremonies were moved up from late march early april to late february since to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success coinciding with the ncaa basketball tournament which would cut into the academy awards audience in and abc regained oscars were moved from tuesday to monday and went directly opposite nbc ncaa title game the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period some years the ceremony is moved into the first sunday of march to avoid clash with the winter olympic games another reason for the move to late february and early march is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter which for decades had been grievance from members and the general public advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast the production of the academy awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most emmys in history with wins and nominations overall since that award own launch in after many years of being held on mondays at pm eastern pacific since the ceremonies it was moved to sundays at pm et pm pt the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays that los angeles rush hour traffic jams could be avoided and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier for many years the film industry opposed sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office in the academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industry long awards season however such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail furthermore january ceremony on sunday would clash with national football league playoff games in the academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late february to mid february beginning with the nd academy awards in originally scheduled for april the th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of dr martin luther king jr on march the rd academy awards was postponed for one day after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington in an in memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding months selection compiled by small committee of academy members this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect with the segment having popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject cultural impact the applause has since been muted during the telecast and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead this segment was later followed by commercial break in terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and half hours the first oscars in lasted minutes at the other end of the spectrum the ceremony lasted four hours and twenty three minutes in the organizers of the academy awards announced winners acceptance speeches must not run past seconds this according to organizer bill mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion in in further effort to streamline speeches winners dedications were displayed on an on screen ticker during the ceremony host jimmy kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become by announcing that he would give brand new jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night reward won by mark bridges when accepting his best costume design award for phantom thread the wall street journal analyzed the average minutes spent across the telecasts as follows on song performances on the hosts speeches on prerecorded clips and on the awards themselves broken into on the introduction and announcement on winners walking to the stage and on their acceptance speeches although still dominant in ratings the viewership of the academy awards has steadily dropped the th academy awards were the lowest rated in the past eight years although with increases in male and viewership while the show itself also faced mixed reception following the show variety reported that abc was in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself currently and nominally ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast including the choice of production staff and hosting although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions in august ampas extended its contract with abc through the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives abc any further creative control over the telecast tv ratings historically the telecast viewership is higher when box office hits are favored to win the best picture award more than million viewers tuned to the telecast for the th academy awards in the year of titanic which generated box office haul during its initial run of us million in the us box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years the th academy awards ceremony in which the lord of the rings the return of the king pre telecast box office earnings of us million received awards including best picture drew million viewers the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date however was the nd academy awards best picture midnight cowboy which drew household rating on april by contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings despite how much critically acclaimed those films have been the th academy awards which awarded low budget independent film crash with pre oscar gross of us million generated an audience of million with household rating of in the th academy awards telecast was watched by million viewers on average with an household rating the lowest rated and least watched ceremony at the time in spite of celebrating years of the academy awards the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film no country for old men the nd academy awards drew an average of million viewers new low archive the academy film archive holds copies of every academy awards ceremony since the oscars and material on many prior ceremonies along with ancillary material related to more recent shows copies are held on variety of film video and digital formats

the awards from to took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york first at the nbc international theatre and then at the nbc century theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in los

pavilion at the los angeles county music center in the late and early the ceremony returned to the shrine in hollywood dolby theatre previously known as the kodak theatre became the presentation current venue awards of merit categories current categories in the first year of the awards the best directing award was split into two categories drama and comedy at times the best original score award has also been split into separate categories drama and comedy musical from the through the the art direction now production design cinematography and costume design awards were likewise split into two categories black and white films and color films prior to the production design award was called art direction while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup in august the academy announced that several categories would not be televised live but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony following dissent from academy members they announced that they would indeed air all categories live this followed number of proposals among them the introduction of popular film category that the academy had announced but did not implement discontinued categories proposed categories the board of governors meets each year and considers new award categories to date the following categories have been proposed best casting rejected in best popular film proposed in for presentation at the ceremony postponed until the ceremony at the earliest best stunt coordination rejected every year from to best title design rejected in special categories the special academy awards are voted on by special committees rather than by the academy membership as whole they are not always presented on an annual basis current special categories academy honorary award since academy scientific and technical award three different awards since gordon sawyer award since jean hersholt humanitarian award since irving thalberg memorial award since academy special achievement award from to and again for discontinued special categories academy juvenile award to criticism accusations of commercialism due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the oscar season this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality william friedkin an academy award winning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at conference in new york in describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself tim dirks editor of amc filmsite org has written of the academy awards recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the oscar season is the whisper campaign these campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against zero dark thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that lincoln distorts history accusations of bias typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over representation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the the last three months of the calendar year the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded this has led to the coining of the term oscar bait describing such movies this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues allegations of lack of diversity the academy awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees this criticism is based on the statistics from every academy awards since which shows us that only of academy award nominees have been non white and since of nominees have been non white with the rate of winners being even more polarizing more white actresses have won oscars for yellowface portrayals of asian characters than actual asian actresses the th awards ceremony became the target of boycott popularized on social media with the hashtag oscarssowhite based on critics perception that its all white acting nominee list reflected bias in response the academy initiated historic changes in membership by the year symbolism or acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity to make up for snub for performance work that proved in time to be more popular and or renowned than the one actually awarded or presented as career honor to recognize distinguished nominee entire body of work recognition of streaming media film following the st academy awards in february in which the netflix broadcast film roma had been nominated for ten awards including the best picture category steven spielberg and other members of the academy discussed changing the requirements through the board of governors for films as to exclude those from netflix and other media streaming services spielberg had been concerned that netflix as movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical oscar winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other best picture nominated films while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical run status to qualify for an oscar the united states department of justice having heard of this potential rule change wrote letter to the academy in march cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti trust concerns against the academy following its april board meeting the academy board of governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs refusals of the award some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars the first to do so was screenwriter dudley nichols best writing in for the informer nichols boycotted the th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild nichols eventually accepted the award three years later at the ceremony nichols was nominated for three further academy awards during his career george scott became the second person to refuse his award best actor in for patton at the rd academy awards ceremony scott described it as meat parade saying don want any part of it the third person to refuse the award was marlon brando who refused his award best actor for the godfather citing the film industry discrimination and mistreatment of native americans at the th academy awards ceremony brando sent actress and civil rights activist sacheen littlefeather to read page speech detailing his criticisms which was booed by the audience incidents at the th academy awards ceremony warren beatty and faye dunaway mistakenly announced la la land as the recipient of the best picture award instead of moonlight the actual winner beatty had been given the wrong envelope and after hesitating during the announcement handed the envelope to dunaway which listed emma stone as best actress for la la land and led to the confusion the proper winner was announced after the acceptance speeches by la la land producers fred berger jordan horowitz and marc platt the following year beatty and dunaway were invited back as presenters of the best picture award which they accomplished without error plagiarism

tai is exactly seconds ahead of utc the seconds results from the initial difference of seconds at the start of plus leap seconds in utc since tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days carried over from non uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth specifically both julian dates and the gregorian calendar are used tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the earth operation tai is weighted average of the time kept by over atomic clocks in over national laboratories worldwide the majority of the clocks involved are caesium clocks the international system of units si definition of the second is based on caesium the clocks are compared using gps signals and two way satellite time and frequency transfer due to the signal averaging tai is an order of magnitude more stable than its best constituent clock the participating institutions each broadcast in real time frequency signal with timecodes which is their estimate of tai time codes are usually published in the form of utc which differs from tai by well known integer number of seconds these time scales are denoted in the form utc npl in the utc form where npl in this case identifies the national physical laboratory uk the tai form may be denoted tai npl the latter is not to be confused with ta npl which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to tai or to anything else the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other the international bureau of weights and measures bipm france combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible this combined time scale is published monthly in circular and is the canonical tai this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc utc equivalent to tai tai for each participating institution the same circular also gives tables of tai ta for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales errors in publication may be corrected by issuing revision of the faulty circular or by errata in subsequent circular aside from this once published in circular the tai scale is not revised in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale since the published circulars are definitive better estimates do not create another version of tai it is instead considered to be creating better realisation of terrestrial time tt history early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory uk npl it was used as basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the royal greenwich observatory and to establish time scale called greenwich atomic ga the united states naval observatory began the scale on september using an atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the nbs scale at the national bureau of standards boulder colorado on october the international time bureau bih began time scale tm or am in july using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals the bih scale and nbs were defined by an epoch at the beginning of the procedures used by the bih evolved and the name for the time scale changed in and ta bih in the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in from to the general conference on weights and measures and the international committee for weights and measures made series of decisions which designated the bipm time scale international atomic time tai in the it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks starting from julian date january corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that tai would correspond to proper time at mean sea level the geoid because the clocks were on average well above sea level this meant that tai slowed by about one part in trillion the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal echelle atomique libre meaning free atomic scale the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time tcb geocentric coordinate time tcg and terrestrial time tt which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system all three of these time scales were defined to read jd january exactly at that instant tai was henceforth realisation of tt with the equation tt tai tai the continued existence of tai was questioned in letter from the bipm to the itu which stated in the case of redefinition of utc without leap seconds the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc relation to utc utc is discontinuous time scale it is regularly adjusted by leap seconds between these adjustments it is composed of segments that are linear transformations of atomic time from its beginning in through december the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated ut afterwards these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate ut this was compromise arrangement in order to enable publicly broadcast time scale the post more linear transformation of the bih atomic time meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally the fact that it continues to approximate ut means that tasks such as navigation which require source of universal time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of utc see also clock synchronization network

giving alms to the poor is often considered an altruistic action altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for happiness of other human beings or animals resulting in quality of life both material and spiritual it is traditional virtue in many cultures and core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions in an extreme case altruism may become synonym of selflessness which is the opposite of selfishness the word altruism was coined by the french philosopher auguste comte in french as altruisme for an antonym of egoism he derived it from the italian altrui which in turn was derived from latin alteri meaning other people or somebody else altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at cost to themselves pleasure and quality of life time probability of survival or reproduction but benefits either directly or indirectly another individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action steinberg suggests definition for altruism in the clinical setting that is intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards in one sense the opposite of altruism is spite spiteful action harms another with no self benefit altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships altruism does not consider relationships much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible in human psychology the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification the validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others used in this sense it is usually contrasted with egoism which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first effective altruism is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others the notion of altruism the concept has long history in philosophical and ethical thought the term was originally coined in the th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science auguste comte and has become major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethologists whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism in simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them scientific viewpoints anthropology marcel mauss book the gift contains passage called note on alms this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice in it he writes alms are the fruits of moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand and of notion of sacrifice on the other generosity is an obligation because nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it this is the ancient morality of the gift which has become principle of justice the gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children evolutionary explanations giving alms to beggar children in the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor in evolutionary psychology this may be applied to wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public goods and theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies some of the proposed mechanisms are kin selection that animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior one kinship cue is facial resemblance one study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons another cue is having the same family name especially if rare and this has been found to increase helpful behavior another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in group using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study this effect was especially strong for firstborns who are typically close to their families vested interests people are likely to suffer if their friends allies and similar social ingroups suffer or even disappear helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness extreme self sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if hostile outgroup threatens to kill the entire ingroup reciprocal altruism see also reciprocity evolution direct reciprocity research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is chance that they can and will reciprocate the help the effective tit for tat strategy is one game theoretic example many people seem to be following similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return one consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future people tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower they tend to help less if they see non cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors simply changing the cooperative framing of proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it community game instead of wall street game tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them this has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity another method is to announce publicly that someone has given large donation the tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped on the other hand people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating people sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to or their helping may not be noticed which may cause unintended conflicts as such it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have slightly generous interpretation of non cooperation people are more likely to cooperate on task if they can communicate with one another first this may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises they are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately direct reciprocity and cooperation in group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population thus giving grades and promotions based only on an individual performance relative to small local group as is common may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group indirect reciprocity the avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes person reputation to become very important person with good reputation for reciprocity has higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously strong reciprocity form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence pseudo reciprocity an organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in way that is selfish but also as byproduct benefits the altruist costly signaling and the handicap principle since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an honest signal of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources this may signal to others that the altruist is valuable potential partner it may also be signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling it is unclear if costly signaling can indicate long term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits resources and cooperative intentions but become potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else similarly holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one resources heroic risk taking has also been interpreted as costly signal of ability volunteers assist hurricane victims at the houston astrodome following hurricane katrina both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions one is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later is publicly announced is discussed or is simply being observed by someone else this have been documented in many studies the effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of logo on computer screen weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by desire to be seen as altruistic people who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners when looking for long term partner altruism may be preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children it has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman while both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man men may even avoid altruistic women in short term relationships which may be because they expect less success people may compete for social benefit from burnished reputation which may cause competitive altruism on the other hand in some experiments proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous this may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic the reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present while humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs benefits as compared to those in the present some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards this may be because such extrinsic top down incentives may replace partially or in whole intrinsic and reputational incentives motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards which overall may make the behaviors less desirable another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them this may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists especially by those who are non cooperators counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all group selection it has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as david sloan wilson that natural selection can act at the level of non kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit non kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level thus while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members see also in group favoritism group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists homeless in new york city such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment this need not imply that on average or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no kin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to non competitors than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george price development of the price equation which is mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as dictyostelium mucoroides these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate long term high cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left wing politics such by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his book mutual aid factor of evolution and peter singer in his book darwinian left neurobiology jorge moll and jordan grafman neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and labs or hospital network provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging in their research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa in october they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex however when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortex septal region these structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species altruism the experiment suggested was not superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hard wired and pleasurable one brain region the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex basal forebrain contributes to learning altruistic behavior especially in those with trait empathy the same study has shown connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding in fact in an experiment published in march at the university of southern california neuroscientist antonio damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers and that when confronted with moral dilemmas these brain damaged patients coldly came up with end justifies the means answers leading damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions but that when they were confronted by difficult issue in this case as whether to shoot down passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits major city these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains according to adrian raine clinical neuroscientist also at the university of southern california one of this study implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse without that awareness people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability in another study in the dr bill harbaugh university of oregon economist concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in similar fmri scanner test in with his psychologist colleague dr ulrich mayr reached the same conclusions of jorge moll and jordan grafman about giving to charity although they were able to divide the study group into two groups egoists and altruists one of their discoveries was that though rarely even some of the considered egoists sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity such as person environment and values psychology the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as motivational state with the goal of increasing another welfare psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase one own welfare there has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism some definitions specify self sacrificial nature to altruism and lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors however because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self daniel batson is psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory he identified four major motives to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit group collectivism or to uphold moral principle principlism altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathy induced altruism can be genuinely selfless the empathy altruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another suffering helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old when toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues peace corps trainees swearing in as volunteers in cambodia april in psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person distress research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the bystander effect greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility however witness with high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism as form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well being in study of older adults those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live and lower in depression anxiety and somatization volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over year period and found that of those who did not belong to volunteer organization experienced major illness while only of those who did volunteer experienced one study on adults ages found that during the four year study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had lower likelihood of dying after controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for reduction in mortality merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well being study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness it is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite direction that happier people are also kinder the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states studies have also been careful to note that feeling over taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness for example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had positive one although positive effects were still significant additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others studies suggest that gratitude goes hand in hand with kindness and is also very important for our well being study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and well being sociology sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society altruism morality and social solidarity american sociological association the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other pro social altruistic actions for the common good is largely researched topic within the field the american sociology association asa acknowledges public sociology saying the intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable altruism morality and social solidarity asa this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies how altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society the motivation of altruism is also the focus of study some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims studies have shown that generosity in laboratory and in online experiments is contagious people imitate observed generosity of others pathological altruism pathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme and either harms the altruistic person or well intentioned actions cause more harm than good the term pathological altruism was popularised by the book pathological altruism examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one own needs hoarding of animals and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid religious viewpoints most if not all of the world religions promote altruism as very important moral value buddhism christianity hinduism islam jainism judaism and sikhism etc place particular emphasis on altruistic morality buddhism monks collecting alms altruism figures prominently in buddhism love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being dalai lama still the notion of altruism is modified in such world view since the belief is that such practice promotes our own happiness the more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of well being becomes dalai lama in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like natural law of cause and effect simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes if one causes suffering then as natural consequence one would experience suffering if one causes happiness then as natural consequence one would experience happiness jainism sculpture depicting the jain concept of ahimsa non injury the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around the concept of altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings jainism preaches the view of ahimsa to live and let live thereby not harming sentient beings uncompromising reverence for all life it also considers all living things to be equal the first tirthankara rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others non violence and compassion for all living things jainism prescribes path of non violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors one unconquered mind with anger pride ego deceit greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans anger spoils good relations pride destroys humility deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness pride by humility deceit by and greed by contentment jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation one must practice the following ethical principles major vows in thought speech and action the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks they are non violence ahimsa truthfulness satya non stealing asteya celibacy brahmacharya non possession or non materialism aparigraha the great vows mahavrata are prescribed for monks and limited vows anuvrata are prescribed for householders the house holders are encouraged to practice the above mentioned five vows the monks have to observe them very strictly with consistent practice it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually accelerating the spiritual progress the principle of non violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become siddha god in jainism because all living beings possess soul great care and awareness is essential in one actions jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small this policy extends even to microscopic organisms jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders christianity altruism is central to the teachings of jesus found in the gospel especially in the sermon on the mount and the sermon on the plain from biblical to medieval christian traditions tensions between self affirmation and other regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of disinterested love as in the pauline phrase love seeks not its own interests in his book indoctrination and self deception roderick hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self affirmation and altruism by analysis of other regard within creative individuation of the self and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many love confirms others in their freedom shuns propaganda and masks assures others of its presence and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others but by each person experience and practice from within as in practical arts the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone but in the making of the connection st thomas aquinas interprets you should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others considering that the love with which man loves himself is the form and root of friendship and quotes aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of part however he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily life since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude more desirable thing than bodily well being in coining the word altruism as stated above comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within catholicism many biblical authors draw strong connection between love of others and love of god john states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman and that hatred of one fellowman is the same as hatred of god thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love an altruistic action is not always loving action oord defines altruism as acting for the other good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one own good when the other demands undermine overall well being german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak one way is sincere expression of christian love motivated by powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of one own life and existence another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for love nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people business at its worst scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse islam in islam the concept ithaar إيثار altruism is the notion of preferring others to oneself for sufis this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one own concerns where concern for others is rooted to be demand made by allah god on the human body considered to be property of allah alone the importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good islam considers those practicing eyaar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility this is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that european concept in thar attention is focused on everything in existence constant concern for allah results in careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world this concept was emphasized by sufis of islam like rabia al adawiyya who paid attention to the difference between dedication to allah and dedication to people thirteenth century turkish sufi poet yunus emre explained this philosophy as yaratılanı severiz yaratandan ötürü or we love the creature because of the creator for many muslims thar must be practiced as religious obligation during specific islamic holidays however thar is also still an islamic ideal to which all muslims should strive to adhere at all times judaism judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation the famous rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity this is defined as bestowal or giving which is the intention of altruism this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto in particular focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework ashlag proposed that such framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity sikhism altruism is essential to the sikh religion the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony truthfulness the concept of seva or selfless service to the community for its own sake is an important concept in sikhism the fifth nanak guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the guru granth the ninth guru tegh bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity in the late seventeenth century guru gobind singh ji the tenth guru in sikhism was in war with the mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when fellow sikh bhai kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh ji and complained of his action that they considered counter productive to their struggle on the battlefield what were you doing and why asked the guru was giving water to the wounded because saw your face in all of them replied bhai kanhaiya the guru responded then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru it was under the tutelage of the guru that bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded volunteer corps for altruism this volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same hinduism in hinduism selflessness atmatyag love prema kindness daya and forgiveness kshama are considered as the highest acts of humanity or manushyattva giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as divine act or punya

songs swami vivekananda the legendary hindu monk has said jive prem kare jeijon seijon sebiche iswar whoever loves any living being is serving god mass donation of clothes to poor people vastraseva or blood donation camp or mass food donation annaseva for poor people is common in various hindu religious ceremonies swami sivananda an advaita scholar reiterates the views in his commentary synthesising vedanta views on the brahma sutras vedantic text in his commentary on chapter of the brahma sutras sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short lived and ceases to exist as soon as deed is executed hence karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at future date according to one merit furthermore one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya which gives fruit since apurva is non sentient it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as god it cannot independently bestow reward or punishment however the very well known and popular text the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga achieving oneness with god through action nishkaama karma or action without expectation desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and is central to hindu morality philosophy there exists wide range of philosophical views on humans obligations or motivations to act altruistically proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically the opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self interest both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co inhabitants related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism the thesis that humans always act in their own self interest and that true altruism is impossible rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one self interest without specifying how this affects one moral obligations effective altruism effective altruism is philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact based upon their values it is the broad evidence based and cause neutral approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidence based practices while substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects companies and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives help people or

institute nbi to promote rand philosophy collective members gave lectures for nbi and wrote articles for objectivist periodicals that she edited rand later published some of these articles in book form critics including some former nbi students and branden himself later described the culture of nbi as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for rand with some describing nbi or the objectivist movement itself as cult or religion rand expressed opinions on wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair and some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers however some former nbi students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated and the problem was concentrated among rand closest followers in new york rand was unimpressed with many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her later years throughout the and rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as yale princeton columbia harvard and the massachusetts institute of technology she received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from lewis clark college on october she also began delivering annual

nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand when she learned of it in though her romantic relationship with branden had already ended rand terminated her relationship with both brandens which led to the closure of nbi rand published an article in the objectivist repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life in subsequent years rand and several more of her closest associates parted company rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in after decades of heavy smoking in she retired from writing her newsletter and after her initial objections she allowed social worker evva pryor an employee of her attorney to enroll her in social security and medicare during the late her activities within the objectivist movement declined especially after the death of her husband on november one of her final projects was work on never completed television adaptation of atlas shrugged rand died of heart failure on march at her home in new york city and was interred in the kensico cemetery valhalla new york rand funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers including alan greenspan floral arrangement in the shape of dollar sign was placed near her casket in her will rand named leonard peikoff to inherit her estate philosophy rand called her philosophy objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute she considered objectivism systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and aesthetics in metaphysics rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion in epistemology she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man senses she rejected all claims of non perceptual or priori knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing in her introduction to objectivist epistemology rand presented theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic synthetic dichotomy in ethics rand argued for rational and ethical egoism rational self interest as the guiding moral principle she said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself she referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title in which she presented her solution to the is ought problem by describing meta ethical theory that based morality in the needs of man survival qua man she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in atlas shrugged that force and mind are opposites rand political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights and she considered laissez faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights she opposed statism which she understood to include theocracy absolute monarchy nazism fascism communism democratic socialism and dictatorship rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by limited government although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian she preferred the term radical for capitalism she worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics she denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism she rejected anarchism as naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice in aesthetics rand defined art as selective re creation of reality according to an artist metaphysical value judgments according to her art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in concrete form that can be easily grasped thereby fulfilling need of human consciousness as writer the art form rand focused on most closely was literature where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will she described her own approach to literature as romantic realism rand acknowledged aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three aristotle aquinas and ayn rand in interview with mike wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of debt to aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me devised the rest of my philosophy myself however she also found early inspiration in friedrich nietzsche and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from rand journals in passages from the first edition of we the living which rand later revised and in her overall writing style however by the time she wrote the fountainhead rand had turned against nietzsche ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed rand considered her philosophical opposite to be immanuel kant whom she referred to as the most evil man in mankind history primarily for his philosophy regarding the limitations of reason rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her theory of concepts ethics and discovery in politics that evil the violation of rights consists of the initiation of force she believed epistemology was foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy stating am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason if one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest follows reception and legacy critical reception during rand lifetime her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation rand first novel we the living was admired by the literary critic mencken her broadway play night of january th was both critical and popular success and the fountainhead was hailed by the new york times reviewer lorine pruette as masterful rand novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic however they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth the first reviews rand received were for night of january th reviews of the production were largely positive but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer rand believed that her first novel we the living was not widely reviewed but rand scholar michael berliner writes it was the most reviewed of any of her works with approximately different reviews being published in more than publications overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work her novella anthem received little attention from reviewers both for its first publication in england and for subsequent re issues rand first bestseller the fountainhead received far fewer reviews than we the living and reviewers opinions were mixed lorine pruette positive review in the new york times was one that rand greatly appreciated pruette called rand writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly and stated that you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time there were other positive reviews but rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel such as one that called it whale of book and another that said anyone who is taken in by it deserves stern lecture on paper rationing other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and rand style offensively pedestrian rand novel atlas shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative in national review conservative author whittaker chambers called the book sophomoric and remarkably silly he described the tone of the book as shrillness without reprieve and accused rand of supporting godless system which he related to that of the soviets claiming from almost any page of atlas shrugged voice can be heard from painful necessity commanding to gas chamber go atlas shrugged received positive reviews from few publications including praise from the noted book reviewer john chamberlain but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in contest to devise the cleverest put downs calling it execrable claptrap and nightmare they also said it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity rand nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book for the new intellectual was similar to that for atlas shrugged with philosopher sidney hook likening her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the soviet union and author gore vidal calling her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers in on the th anniversary of rand birth edward rothstein writing for the new york times referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian retro fantasy and programmatic neo romanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters isolated rejection of democratic society in book critic leslie clark described her fiction as romance novels with patina of pseudo philosophy in gq critic columnist tom carson described her books as capitalism version of middlebrow religious novels such as ben hur and the left behind series reviewing the posthumously published novel ideal the new york times chief book critic michiko kakutani assessed rand didactic ideological work as stylistically having great deal in common with the message minded socialist realism produced in the soviet union which she left in the mid and vociferously denounced popular interest the american adventure rotunda at walt disney world epcot in survey conducted for the library of congress and the book of the month club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent life was rand atlas shrugged was the second most popular choice after the bible rand books continue to be widely sold and read with over million copies sold with about of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the ayn rand institute in modern library readers voted atlas shrugged the th century finest work of fiction followed by the fountainhead in second place anthem in seventh and we the living eighth none of the four appeared on the critics list although rand influence has been greatest in the united states there has been international interest in her work rand contemporary admirers included fellow novelists such as ira levin kay nolte smith and neil smith and later writers such as erika holzer and terry goodkind have been influenced by her other artists who have cited rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist steve ditko and musician neil peart of rush rand provided positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work john allison of bb and ed snider of comcast spectacor have funded the promotion of rand ideas while mark cuban owner of the dallas mavericks as well as john mackey ceo of whole foods among others have said they consider rand crucial to their success rand and her works have been referred to in variety of media on television shows including animated sitcoms live action comedies dramas and game shows as well as in movies and video games she or character based on her figures prominently in positive and negative lights in literary and science fiction novels by prominent american authors one such depiction is found in the character anna granite with her philosophy of definitivism in mary gaitskill novel two girls fat and thin nick gillespie editor in chief of reason has remarked that rand is tortured immortality one in which she as likely to be punch line as protagonist and that jibes at rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture two movies have been made about rand life documentary film ayn rand sense of life was nominated for the academy award for best documentary feature the passion of ayn rand television adaptation of the book of the same name won several awards rand image also appears on postage stamp illustrated by artist nick gaetano political influence although she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian rand has had continuing influence on right wing politics and libertarianism jim powell senior fellow at the cato institute considers rand one of the three most important women along with rose wilder lane and isabel paterson of modern american libertarianism and david nolan one of the founders of the libertarian party stated that without ayn rand the libertarian movement would not exist in his history of the libertarian movement journalist brian doherty described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large and biographer jennifer burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right economist and ayn rand student george reisman wrote ayn rand in particular must be cited as providing philosophical foundation for the case of capitalism and as being responsible probably more than anyone else for the current spread of pro capitalist ideas protester at tea party rally carries sign referring to john galt the hero of rand novel atlas shrugged she faced intense opposition from william buckley jr and other contributors for the national review magazine they published numerous criticisms in the and by whittaker chambers garry wills and stanton evans nevertheless her influence among conservatives forced buckley and other national review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives often members of the republican party despite rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives such as being pro choice and an atheist article in the new york times referred to her as the reagan administration novelist laureate republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels the financial crisis of spurred renewed interest in her works especially atlas shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis opinion articles compared real world events with the plot of the novel during this time signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests there was also increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on alan greenspan for example mother jones remarked that rand particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy the talented and the powerful as the oppressed while equating randian individual well being with that of the volk according to goebbels corey robin of the nation alleged similarities between the moral syntax of randianism and fascism academic reaction scholarly reception during rand lifetime during rand lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars when the first academic book about rand philosophy appeared in its author declared writing about rand treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously few articles about rand ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in many of them in the personalist one of these was on the randian argument by libertarian philosopher robert nozick who argued that her meta ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is ought problem posed by david hume other philosophers writing in the same publication argued that nozick misstated rand case academic consideration of rand as literary figure during her life was even more limited academic mimi gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about rand novels when she began researching her in and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the posthumous overall assessments since rand death interest in her work has gradually increased in historian jennifer burns identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in rand including an explosion of scholarship since the year however as of that same year few universities included rand or objectivism as philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as pop culture phenomenon rather than subject for serious study writing in the edition of the routledge encyclopedia of philosophy political theorist chandran kukathas summarizes the mainstream philosophical reception to her work in two parts her ethical argument he says is viewed by most commentators as an unconvincing variant of aristotle ethics her political theory he says is of little interest marred by an ill thought out and unsystematic effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism libertarian philosopher michael huemer argues that very few people find rand ideas convincing especially her ethics which he believes are difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence he attributes the attention she receives to her being compelling writer especially as novelist noting that atlas shrugged outsells rand non fiction works as well as the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as ludwig von mises friedrich hayek or frederic bastiat several critics claim that the novel what is to be done by russian author nikolay chernyshevsky is an embodiment of rational egoism and one of the sources of inspiration for rand thought for example the book main character lopuhov says am not man to make sacrifices and indeed there are no such things one acts in the way that one finds most pleasant regarding rand particular disdain for the philosophy of immanuel kant philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued that she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences political scientist charles murray while praising rand literary accomplishments criticizes her claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche although rand maintained that objectivism was an integrated philosophical system philosopher robert bass argues that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas in the literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in john david lewis declared that rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation rand specific scholarship some scholars focus specifically on rand work in allan gotthelf george walsh and david kelley co founded the ayn rand society group affiliated with the american philosophical association

published by cambridge university press rand ideas have also been made subjects of study at clemson and duke universities scholars of english and american literature have largely ignored her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the rand scholars douglas den uyl and douglas rasmussen while stressing the importance and originality of her thought describe her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional political writer and rand scholar jack wheeler writes that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage rand ethics are most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought objectivist movement in rand intellectual heir leonard peikoff established the ayn rand institute nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting rand ideas and works in after an ideological disagreement with peikoff philosopher david kelley founded the institute for objectivist studies now known as

turn derives from the arabic the islands truncated form of the older islands of the mazghanna tribe employed by medieval geographers such as al idrisi history prehistory and ancient history roman ruins at djémila in the region of ain hanech saïda province early remnants bc of hominid occupation in north africa were found neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levalloisian and mousterian styles bc similar to those in the levant algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques tools of this era starting about bc are called aterian after the archeological site of bir el ater south of tebessa the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian located mainly in the oran region this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between and bc neolithic civilization animal domestication and agriculture developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghreb perhaps as early as bc or as late as between and bc this life richly depicted in the tassili ajjer paintings predominated in algeria until the classical period the mixture of peoples of north africa coalesced eventually into distinct native population that came to be called berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern africa roman ruins of timgadon the street leading to the local arch of trajan from their principal center of power at carthage the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african coast by bc phoenician presence existed at tipasa east of cherchell hippo regius modern annaba and rusicade modern skikda these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages as carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically berber civilization was already at stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organization supported several states trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others by the early th century bc berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army in the revolt of the mercenaries berber soldiers rebelled from to bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war they succeeded in obtaining control of much of carthage north african territory and they minted coins bearing the name libyan used in greek to describe natives of north africa the carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic wars in bc the city of carthage was destroyed as carthaginian power waned the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew by the nd century bc several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged two of them were established in numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage west of numidia lay mauretania which extended across the moulouya river in modern day morocco to the atlantic ocean the high point of berber civilization unequaled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than millennium later was reached during the reign of masinissa in the nd century bc numidia along with egypt rome and carthage bc after masinissa death in bc the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times masinissa line survived until ad when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans who founded many colonies in the region like the rest of north africa algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products saint augustine was the bishop of hippo regius modern day annaba algeria located in the roman province of africa the germanic vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in and by controlled coastal numidia they did not make any significant settlement on the land as they were harassed by local tribes in fact by the time the byzantines arrived leptis magna was abandoned and the msellata region was occupied by the indigenous laguatan who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political military and cultural revival middle ages mansourah mosque tlemcen after negligible resistance from the locals muslim arabs of the umayyad caliphate conquered algeria in the early th century dihya memorial in khenchela algeria large numbers of the indigenous berber people converted to islam christians berber and latin speakers remained in the great majority in tunisia until the end of the th century and muslims only became vast majority some time in the th after the fall of the umayyad caliphate numerous local dynasties emerged including the aghlabids almohads abdalwadid zirids rustamids hammadids almoravids and the fatimids the christians left in three waves after the initial conquest in the th century and the th the last were evacuated to sicily by the normans and the few remaining died out in the th century during the middle ages north africa was home to many great scholars saints and sovereigns including judah ibn quraysh the first grammarian to mention semitic and berber languages the great sufi masters sidi boumediene abu madyan and sidi el houari and the emirs abd al mu min and yāghmūrasen it was during this time that the fatimids or children of fatima daughter of muhammad came to the maghreb these fatimids went on to found long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb hejaz and the levant boasting secular inner government as well as powerful army and navy made up primarily of arabs and levantines extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded in order to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them the resultant war is recounted in the epic tāghribāt in al tāghrībāt the amazigh zirid hero khālīfā al zānatī asks daily for duels to defeat the hilalan hero ābu zayd al hilalī and many other arab knights in string of victories the zirids however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture the indigenous amazigh tribes however remained largely independent and depending on tribe location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb at times unifying it as under the fatimids the fatimid islamic state also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa sicily palestine jordan lebanon syria egypt the red sea coast of africa tihamah hejaz and yemen caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era shia ismaili dynasty that ruled much of north africa the amazighs historically consisted of several tribes the two main branches were the botr and barnès tribes who were divided into tribes and again into sub tribes each region of the maghreb contained several tribes for example sanhadja houara zenata masmouda kutama awarba and berghwata all these tribes made independent territorial decisions several amazigh dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands ibn khaldun provides table summarising the amazigh dynasties of the maghreb region the zirid banu ifran maghrawa almoravid hammadid almohad merinid abdalwadid wattasid meknassa and hafsid dynasties the berber almohad caliphate at its greatest extent there reigned in ifriqiya current tunisia berber family zirid somehow recognising the suzerainty of the fatimid caliph of cairo probably in the zirid ruler or viceroy el mu izz decided to end this suzerainty the fatimid state was too weak to attempt punitive expedition the viceroy el mu izz also found another means of revenge between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulent influence both banu hilal and banu sulaym among others whose presence disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot the then fatimid vizier devised to relinquish control of the maghreb and obtained the agreement of his sovereign this not only prompted the bedouins to leave but the fatimid treasury even gave them light expatriation cash allowance whole tribes set off with women children ancestors animals and camping equipment some stopped on the way especially in cyrenaica where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the gabes region the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide but with each encounter the last under the walls of kairouan his troops were defeated and the arabs remained masters of the field the flood was still rising and in the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine where they gradually choked qalaa of banu hammad as they had done in kairouan few decades ago from there they gradually gained the upper algiers and oran plains some were forcibly taken by the almohads in the second half of the th century we can say that in the th century the arabs were in all of north africa with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions which remained entirely berber the influx of bedouin tribes was major factor in the linguistic cultural arabization of the maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant ibn khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by banu hilal tribes had become completely arid desert in the early th century spain constructed fortified outposts presidios on or near the algerian coast spain took control of few coastal towns like mers el kebir in oran in and tlemcen mostaganem and ténès in in the same year few merchants of algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbour to spain which built fort on it the presidios in north africa turned out to be costly and largely ineffective military endeavour that did not guarantee access for spain merchant fleet ottoman era zayyanid kingdom of tlemcen in the fifteenth century and its neighbors the region of algeria was partially ruled by ottomans for three centuries from to in the turkish privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa who operated successfully under the hafsids moved their base of operations to algiers they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spaniards but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region forcing the previous ruler abu hamo musa iii of the bani ziyad dynasty to flee when aruj was killed in during his invasion of tlemcen hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers the ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and contingent of some janissaries with the aid of this force hayreddin conquered the whole area between constantine and oran although the city of oran remained in spanish hands until hayreddin barbarossa the next beylerbey was hayreddin son hasan who assumed the position in until the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits subsequently with the institution of regular ottoman administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for three year terms the pasha was assisted by janissaries known in algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha as result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in plague had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa algiers lost from to inhabitants to the plague in and suffered high fatalities in and in the taifa rebelled killed the agha and placed one of its own in power the new leader received the title of dey after the right to select the dey passed to the divan council of some sixty nobles it was at first dominated by the ojaq but by the th century it had become the dey instrument in the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent replacing the pasha in that role although algiers remained part of the ottoman empire the dey was in effect constitutional autocrat the dey was elected for life term but in the years that the system survived fourteen of the twenty nine deys were assassinated despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the day to day operation of ottoman government was remarkably orderly although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regency authority was seldom applied in the kabylie christian slaves in algiers the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other non islamic shipping in the western mediterranean sea the pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves they also did brisk business in ransoming some of the captives according to robert davis from the th to th century pirates captured million to million europeans as slaves they often made raids called razzias on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slave markets in north africa and other parts of the ottoman empire in for example hayreddin barbarossa captured the island of ischia taking prisoners and enslaved some inhabitants of lipari almost the entire population in the ottoman governor of algiers turgut reis enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera the introduction of broad sail ships from the beginning of the th century allowed them to branch out into the atlantic bombardment of algiers by the anglo dutch fleet to support the ultimatum to release european slaves august in july two pirate ships from algiers under the command of dutch pirate jan janszoon sailed as far as iceland raiding and capturing slaves two weeks earlier another pirate ship from salé in morocco had also raided in iceland some of the slaves brought to algiers were later ransomed back to iceland but some chose to stay in algeria in pirate ships from algeria raided the faroe islands barbary raids in the mediterranean continued to attack spanish merchant shipping and as result the spanish navy bombarded algiers in and for the attack in the spanish fleet was to be joined by ships from such traditional enemies of algiers as naples portugal and the knights of malta over cannonballs were fired much of the city and its fortifications were destroyed and most of the algerian fleet was sunk in the th century the pirates forged affiliations with caribbean powers paying licence tax in exchange for safe harbour of their vessels piracy on american vessels in the mediterranean resulted in the united states initiating the first and second barbary wars following those wars algeria was weaker and europeans with an anglo dutch fleet commanded by the british lord exmouth attacked algiers after nine hour bombardment they obtained treaty from the dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by captain later commodore stephen decatur navy concerning the demands of tributes in addition the dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving christians despite being removed from algeria in the th century spain retained presence in morocco algeria consistently opposed spanish fortresses and control in nearby morocco through the th century french colonization battle of somah in under the pretext of slight to their consul the french invaded and captured algiers in historian ben kiernan wrote on the french conquest of algeria by the french conquest was complete the war had killed approximately indigenous algerians since french losses from were dead in the hospital and only killed in action the population of algeria which stood at about million in reached nearly million in french policy was predicated on civilizing the country the slave trade and piracy in algeria ceased following the french conquest the conquest of algeria by the french took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous algerian population to decline by nearly one third from to during this period small but influential french speaking indigenous elite was formed made up of berbers mostly kabyles as consequence french government favored the kabyles about of indigenous schools were constructed for kabyles emir abdelkader algerian leader insurgent against french colonial rule from until independence france administered the whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and département of the nation one of france longest held overseas territories algeria became destination for hundreds of thousands of european immigrants who became known as colons and later as pied noirs between and french people emigrated to algeria these settlers benefited from the french government confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land many europeans settled in oran and algiers and by the early th century they formed majority of the population in both cities the six historical leaders of the fln rabah bitat mostefa ben boulaïd didouche mourad mohammed boudiaf krim belkacem and larbi ben hidi during the late th and early th century the european share was almost fifth of the population the french government aimed at making algeria an assimilated part of france and this included substantial educational investments especially after the indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency but in contrast to the other colonised countries path in central asia and caucasus algeria kept its individual skills and relatively human capital intensive agriculture gradually dissatisfaction among the muslim population which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from france in may the uprising against the occupying french forces was suppressed through what is now known as the sétif and guelma massacre tensions between the two population groups came to head in when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began historians have estimated that between and harkis and their dependents were killed by the front de libération nationale fln or by lynch mobs in algeria the fln used hit and run attacks in algeria and france as part of its war and the french conducted severe reprisals the war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries historians like alistair horne and raymond aron state that the actual number of algerian muslim war dead was far greater than the original fln and official french estimates but was less than the million deaths claimed by the algerian government after independence horne estimated algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around the war uprooted more than million algerians the war against french rule concluded in when algeria gained complete independence following the march evian agreements and the july self determination referendum some estimates put the algerian death toll during the french colonial rule at over million the first three decades of independence the number of european pied noirs who fled algeria totaled more than between and the exodus to mainland france accelerated after the oran massacre of in which hundreds of militants entered european sections of the city and began attacking civilians houari boumediene algeria first president was the front de libération nationale fln leader ahmed ben bella morocco claim to portions of western algeria led to the sand war in ben bella was overthrown in by houari boumédiène his former ally and defence minister under ben bella the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian boumédienne continued this trend but he relied much more on the army for his support and reduced the sole legal party to symbolic role he collectivised agriculture and launched massive drive oil extraction facilities were nationalised this was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international oil crisis in the and under president houari boumediene algeria pursued program of within state controlled socialist economy boumediene successor chadli bendjedid introduced some liberal economic reforms he promoted policy of arabisation in algerian society and public life teachers of arabic brought in from other muslim countries spread conventional islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of return to orthodox islam the algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the oil glut economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in algerian social unrest during the by the end of the decade bendjedid introduced multi party system political parties developed such as the islamic salvation front fis broad coalition of muslim groups civil war and aftermath massacres of over people in the armed islamic group gia claimed responsibility for many of them in december the islamic salvation front dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections fearing the election of an islamist government the authorities intervened on january cancelling the elections bendjedid resigned and high council of state was installed to act as the presidency it banned the fis triggering civil insurgency between the front armed wing the armed islamic group and the national armed forces in which more than people are thought to have died the islamist militants conducted violent campaign of civilian massacres at several points in the conflict the situation in algeria became point of international concern most notably during the crisis surrounding air france flight hijacking perpetrated by the armed islamic group the armed islamic group declared ceasefire in october algeria held elections in considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by president abdelaziz bouteflika he worked to restore political stability to the country and announced civil concord initiative approved in referendum under which many political prisoners were pardoned and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under limited amnesty in force until january the ais disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly the groupe salafiste pour la prédication et le combat gspc splinter group of the armed islamic group continued terrorist campaign against the government bouteflika was re elected in the april presidential election after campaigning on programme of national reconciliation the programme comprised economic institutional political and social reform to modernise the country raise living standards and tackle the causes of alienation it also included second amnesty initiative the charter for peace and national reconciliation which was approved in referendum in september it offered amnesty to most guerrillas and government security forces in november the algerian constitution was amended following vote in parliament removing the two term limit on presidential incumbents this change enabled bouteflika to stand

anthropology studies cultural meaning including norms and values linguistic anthropology studies how language influences social life biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans visual anthropology which is usually considered to be part of social anthropology can mean both ethnographic film where photography film and new media are used for study as well as the study of visuals including art visual images cinema etc oxford bibliographies describes visual anthropology as the anthropological study of the visual and the visual study of the anthropological archaeology which studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence is considered branch of anthropology in the united states and canada while in europe it is viewed as discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines such as history origin and development of the term bernardino de sahagún is considered to be the founder of modern anthropology the abstract noun anthropology is first attested in reference to history its present use first appeared in renaissance germany in the works of magnus hundt and otto casmann their new latin derived from the combining forms of the greek words ánthrōpos human and lógos study its adjectival form appeared in the works of aristotle it began to be used in english possibly via french by the early th century through the th century in the bartholins founders of the university of copenhagen defined as follows sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently such as the use by étienne serres in to describe the natural history or paleontology of man based on comparative anatomy and the creation of chair in anthropology and ethnography in at the french national museum of natural history by jean louis armand de quatrefages de bréau various short lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed the société ethnologique de paris the first to use ethnology was formed in its members were primarily anti slavery activists when slavery was abolished in france in the société was abandoned meanwhile the ethnological society of new york currently the american ethnological society was founded on its model in as well as the ethnological society of london in break away group of the aborigines protection society these anthropologists of the times were liberal anti slavery and pro human rights activists they maintained international connections anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier th century theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy linguistics and ethnology making feature by feature comparisons of their subject matters were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals languages and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then for them the publication of charles darwin on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the société de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies the société anthropologie de paris meeting for the first time in paris in when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to transformisme as the french called evolutionism his definition now became the study of the human group considered as whole in its details and in relation to the rest of nature broca being what today would be called neurosurgeon had taken an interest in the pathology of speech he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals which appeared to reside in speech he discovered the speech center of the human brain today called broca area after him his interest was mainly in biological anthropology but german philosopher specializing in psychology theodor waitz took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six volume work entitled die anthropologie der naturvölker the title was soon translated as the anthropology of primitive peoples the last two volumes were published posthumously waitz defined anthropology as the science of the nature of man following broca lead waitz points out that anthropology is new field which would gather material from other fields but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy physiology and psychology to differentiate man from the animals nearest to him he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical gathered by experimentation the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species man is unity and that the same laws of thought are applicable to all men waitz was influential among the british ethnologists in the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology it was the nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence representatives from the french société were present though not broca in his keynote address printed in the first volume of its new publication the anthropological review hunt stressed the work of waitz adopting his definitions as standard among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor inventor of cultural anthropology and his brother alfred tylor geologist previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist subsequently an anthropologist similar organizations in other countries followed the anthropological society of madrid the american anthropological association in the anthropological society of vienna the italian society of anthropology and ethnology and many others subsequently the majority of these were evolutionist one notable exception was the berlin society for anthropology ethnology and prehistory founded by rudolph virchow known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists not religious himself he insisted that darwin conclusions lacked empirical foundation during the last three decades of the th century proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred most independent most publishing their own journals and all international in membership and association the major theorists belonged to these organizations they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning by educational institutions in countries had some curriculum in anthropology none of the faculty members were under department named anthropology th and st centuries this meager statistic expanded in the th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world higher educational institutions many thousands in number anthropology has diversified from few major subdivisions to dozens more practical anthropology the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems has arrived for example the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene the organization has reached global level for example the world council of anthropological associations wcaa network of national regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology currently contains members from about three dozen nations since the work of franz boas and bronisław malinowski in the late th and early th centuries social anthropology in great britain and cultural anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on cross cultural comparisons long term in depth examination of context and the importance they place on participant observation or experiential immersion in the area of research cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism holism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques this has been particularly prominent in the united states from boas arguments against th century racial ideology through margaret mead advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation to current criticisms of post colonial oppression and promotion of ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork in great britain and the commonwealth countries the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate in the united states anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by franz boas in the early th century biological or physical anthropology social cultural or sociocultural anthropology and archaeology plus anthropological linguistics these fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques european countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology term coined and defined by adam kollár in it is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european tradition fields anthropology is global discipline involving humanities social sciences and natural sciences anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of homo sapiens human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and from social sciences including the organization of human social and cultural relations institutions social conflicts etc early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity such as by al biruni of the islamic golden age as such anthropology has been central in the development of several new late th century fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studies according to clifford geertz sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories as well as shift toward the analysis of modern societies during the and there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline during this shift enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy central place in cultural and social anthropology in contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist due to this difference in epistemology the four sub fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades sociocultural sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among individuals and groups cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy literature and the arts how one culture affects the experience for self and group contributing to more complete understanding of the people knowledge customs and institutions while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history in that it helps develop an understanding of social structures typically of others and other populations such as minorities subgroups dissidents etc there is no hard and fast distinction between them and these categories overlap to considerable degree inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross cultural comparison this project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography ethnography can refer to both methodology and the product of ethnographic research an ethnographic monograph as methodology ethnography is based upon long term fieldwork within community or other research site participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures the process of participant observation can be especially helpful to understanding culture from an emic conceptual vs etic or technical point of view the study of kinship and social organization is central focus of sociocultural anthropology as kinship is human universal sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization law and conflict resolution patterns of consumption and exchange material culture technology infrastructure gender relations ethnicity childrearing and socialization religion myth symbols values etiquette worldview sports music nutrition recreation games food festivals and language which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology comparison across cultures is key element of method in sociocultural anthropology including the industrialized and de industrialized west the standard cross cultural sample sccs includes such cultures of world societies are biological forensic anthropologists can help identify skeletonized human remains such as these found lying in scrub in western australia biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non human primates in their biological evolutionary and demographic dimensions it examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates and that generate maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation archaeological archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains artifacts faunal remains and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies archaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices is type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups who are presumed to have lived in similar ways the rosetta stone was an example of ancient communication linguistic linguistic anthropology not to be confused with anthropological linguistics seeks to understand the processes of human communications verbal and non verbal variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including pragmatics cognitive linguistics semiotics discourse analysis and narrative analysis key topics by field sociocultural art media music dance and film art one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as cultural phenomenon several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of painting sculpture or literature conceived as independent artistic activities do not exist or exist in significantly different form in most non western contexts to surmount this difficulty anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which without exclusively being artistic have certain evident aesthetic qualities boas primitive art claude lévi strauss the way of the masks or geertz art as cultural system are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturally specific aesthetics media punu tribe mask gabon central africa media anthropology also known as the anthropology of media or mass media emphasizes ethnographic studies as means of understanding producers audiences and other cultural and social aspects of mass media the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers journalists in the field film production to contexts of media reception following audiences in their everyday responses to media other types include cyber anthropology relatively new area of internet research as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media such as development work social movements or health education this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts where media such as radio the press new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early music ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music broadly defined that emphasize its cultural social material cognitive biological and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire ethnomusicology can be used in wide variety of fields such as teaching politics cultural anthropology etc while the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the th and th centuries it was formally introduced as ethnomusicology by dutch scholar jaap kunst around later the influence of study in this area spawned the creation of the periodical ethnomusicology and the society of ethnomusicology visual visual anthropology is concerned in part with the study and production of ethnographic photography film and since the mid new media while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation including areas such as performance museums art and the production and reception of mass media visual representations from all cultures such as sandpaintings tattoos sculptures and reliefs cave paintings scrimshaw jewelry hieroglyphics paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology economic political economic applied and development economic economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic geographic and cultural scope it has complex relationship with the discipline of economics of which it is highly critical its origins as sub field of anthropology begin with the polish british founder of anthropology bronisław malinowski and his french compatriot marcel mauss on the nature of gift giving exchange or reciprocity as an alternative to market exchange economic anthropology remains for the most part focused upon exchange the school of thought derived from marx and known as political economy focuses on production in contrast economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists and have now turned to examine corporations banks and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective political economy political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology including but not limited to non capitalist societies political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture three main areas of interest rapidly developed the first of these areas was concerned with the pre capitalist societies that were subject to evolutionary tribal stereotypes sahlin work on hunter gatherers as the original affluent society did much to dissipate that image the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world population at the time the peasantry many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam the third area was on colonialism imperialism and the creation of the capitalist world system more recently these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial and post industrial capitalism around the world applied applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems it is complex of related research based instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data initiation of direct action and or the formulation of policy more simply applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community it is closely related to development anthropology distinct from the more critical anthropology of development development anthropology of development tends to view development from critical perspective the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why if key development goal is to alleviate poverty is poverty increasing why is there such gap between plans and outcomes why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis in short why does so much planned development fail kinship feminism gender and sexuality kinship kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves over its history anthropology has developed number of related concepts and terms such as descent descent groups lineages affines cognates and even fictive kinship broadly kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent one social relations during development and also relatives by marriage within kinship you have two different families people have their biological families and it is the people they share dna with this is called consanguineal relations or blood ties people can also have chosen family finding connection through chosen family in which they chose who they want to be part of their family in some cases people are closer with their chosen family more than with their biological families feminist feminist anthropology is four field approach to anthropology archeological biological cultural linguistic that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings anthropological hiring practices and the scholarly production of knowledge anthropology engages often with feminists from non western traditions whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white european and american feminists historically such peripheral perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology as specialization the first african american female anthropologist and caribbeanist is said to be vera mae green who studied ethnic and family relations in the caribbean as well as the united states and thereby tried to improve the way black life experiences and culture were studied medical nutritional psychological cognitive and transpersonal medical medical anthropology is an field which studies human health and disease health care systems and biocultural adaptation it is believed that william caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology currently research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as whole it focuses on the following six basic fields other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering farmer beneduce as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not result of illness on the other hand there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry nutritional nutritional anthropology is synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems nutritional status and food security and how changes in the former affect the latter if economic and environmental changes in community affect access to food food security and dietary health then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization nutritional status affects overall health status work performance potential and the overall potential for economic development either in terms of human development or traditional western models for any given group of people psychological psychological anthropology is an subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within particular cultural group with its own history language practices and conceptual categories shape processes of human cognition emotion perception motivation and mental health it also examines how the understanding of cognition emotion motivation and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes cognitive cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge cultural innovation and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology often through close collaboration with historians ethnographers archaeologists linguists musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them transpersonal transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture as with transpersonal psychology the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness asc and transpersonal experience however the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross cultural issues for instance the roles of myth ritual diet and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences political and legal political political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems looked at from the basis of the structure of societies political anthropology developed as discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies new development started from the and is still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly to study more complex social settings in which the presence of states bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels firstly anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state regulated sphere as in patron client relations or tribal political organization secondly anthropologists slowly started to develop disciplinary concern with states and their institutions and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions an anthropology of the state developed and it is most thriving field today geertz comparative work on negara the balinese state is an early famous example legal legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in the cross cultural study of social ordering earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management crime sanctions or formal regulation more recent applications include issues such as human rights legal pluralism and political uprisings public public anthropology was created by robert borofsky professor at hawaii pacific university to demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change nature science and technology cyborg cyborg anthropology originated as sub focus group within the american anthropological association annual meeting in the sub group was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science donna haraway cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings digital digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital era technology and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect it is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology and sometimes considered part of material culture the field is new and thus has variety of names with variety of emphases these include techno anthropology digital ethnography and virtual anthropology ecological ecological anthropology is defined as the study of cultural adaptations to environments the sub field is also defined as the study of relationships between population of humans and their biophysical environment the focus of its research concerns how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments and how their environments change across space and time the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology and arguably at least the backdrop if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today is political ecology many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture politics and power globalization localized issues century anthropology and more the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for against or creation of policy and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land often the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly organizing participation or indirectly articles documentaries books ethnographies such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park historical ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records it is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps music paintings photography folklore oral tradition site exploration archaeological materials museum collections enduring customs language and place names religion the anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion and that every religion is cultural product created by the human community that worships it urban urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization poverty and neoliberalism ulf hannerz quotes remark that traditional anthropologists were notoriously agoraphobic lot anti urban by definition various social processes in the western world as well as in the third world the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists brought the attention of specialists in other cultures closer to their homes there are two main approaches to urban anthropology examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities these two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other by defining different types of cities one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities by directly looking at the different social issues one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city key topics by field archaeological and biological anthrozoology anthrozoology also known as human animal studies is the study of interaction between living things it is an field that overlaps with number of other disciplines including anthropology ethology medicine psychology veterinary medicine and zoology major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions it includes scholars from diverse range of fields including anthropology sociology biology and philosophy biocultural biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the th century viewed this relationship from racial perspective that is from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences after world war ii the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology evolutionary evolutionary anthropology is the study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non hominin primates evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science combining the human development with socioeconomic factors evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans past and present it is based on scientific approach and brings together fields such as archaeology behavioral ecology psychology primatology and genetics it is dynamic and field drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience past and present forensic forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in legal setting most often in criminal cases where the victim remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed burned mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable the adjective forensic refers to the application of this subfield of science to court of law five of the seven known fossil teeth of homo luzonensis found in callao cave combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology it is the study of ancient humans as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints genetics and morphology of specimens are crucially important to this field markers on specimens such as enamel fractures and dental decay on teeth can also give insight into the behaviour and diet of past populations organizations contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges the single largest organization of anthropologists is the american anthropological association aaa which was founded in its members are anthropologists from around the globe in group of european and american scholars in the field of anthropology established the european association of social anthropologists easa which serves as major professional organization for anthropologists working in europe the easa seeks to advance the status of anthropology in europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of global anthropology or world anthropology hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub fields of anthropology sometimes divided up by nation or region and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines such as geology physics zoology paleontology anatomy music theory art history sociology and so on belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well list of major organizations american

anthropology ethics as the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves and professional societies have generated codes of ethics anthropologists like other researchers especially historians and scientists engaged in field research have over time assisted state policies and projects especially colonialism some commentators have contended that the discipline grew out of colonialism perhaps was in league with it and derives some of its key notions from it consciously or not see for example gough pels and salemink but cf lewis that ethnographic work is often ahistorical writing about people as if they were out of time in an ethnographic present johannes fabian time and its other cultural relativism as part of their quest for scientific objectivity present day anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism which has an influence on all the sub fields of anthropology this is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another values or viewpoints but be examined dispassionately on their own terms there should be no notions in good anthropology of one culture being better or worse than another culture ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide infanticide racism mutilation including circumcision and subincision and torture topics like racism slavery and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation have been proposed not to mention theories of colonialism and many others as root causes of man inhumanity to man to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach one can take just one of these topics such as racism and find thousands of anthropological references stretching across all the major and minor sub fields military involvement anthropologists involvement with the government in particular has caused bitter controversy within the discipline franz boas publicly objected to us participation in world war and after the war he published brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several american archaeologists in espionage in mexico under their cover as scientists but by the many of boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the axis powers nazi germany fascist italy and imperial japan many served in the armed forces while others worked in intelligence for example office of strategic services and the office of war information at the same time david price work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the cia and government intelligence activities during the vietnam war years have turned up surprisingly little many anthropologists students and teachers were active in the antiwar movement numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the american anthropological association aaa professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth asa has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous the principles of professional responsibility issued by the american anthropological association and amended through november stated that in relation with their own government and with host governments no secret research no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given the current principles of professional responsibility does not make explicit mention of ethics surrounding state interactions anthropologists along with other social scientists are working with the us military as part of the us army strategy in afghanistan the christian science monitor reports that efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs in afghanistan under the human terrain system hts program in addition hts teams are working with the us military in iraq in the american anthropological association commission on the engagement of anthropology with the us security and intelligence communities released its final report concluding in part that when ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions not subject to external review where data collection occurs in the context of war integrated into the goals of and in potentially coercive environment all characteristic factors of the hts concept and its application it can no longer be considered legitimate professional exercise of anthropology in summary while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible ceaussic suggests that the aaa emphasize the incompatibility of hts with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing hts to define the meaning of anthropology within dod post world war ii developments before wwii british social anthropology and american cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions after the war enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as sociocultural anthropology basic trends there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study particular place problem or phenomenon in detail using variety of methods over more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia in the and calls for clarification of what constitutes culture of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard these dynamic relationships between what can be observed on the ground as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology whether cultural biological linguistic or archaeological biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals behaviors ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures they use many different methods of study but modern population genetics participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists into the field which means traveling to community in its own setting to do something called fieldwork on the biological or physical side human measurements genetic samples nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material such as the paleolithic and the neolithic of particular use in archaeology further cultural subdivisions according to tool types such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well since mapping cultures is central to both sciences by making comparisons across cultural traditions time based and cultural regions space based anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method central part of their science commonalities between fields because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises see history of anthropology including but not limited to fossil hunting exploring documentary film making paleontology primatology antiquity dealings and curatorship philology etymology genetics regional analysis ethnology history philosophy and religious studies it is difficult to characterize the entire field in brief article although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of other cultures both in terms of time past societies and space non european non western societies for example the classic of urban anthropology ulf hannerz in the introduction to his seminal exploring the city inquiries toward an urban anthropology mentions that the third world had habitually received most of attention anthropologists who traditionally specialized in other cultures looked for them far away and started to look across the tracks only in late now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author home it is also argued that other fields of study like history and sociology on the contrary focus on the west in france the study of western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists but this is increasingly changing starting in the from scholars like isac chiva and journals like terrain fieldwork and developing with the center founded by marc augé le centre anthropologie des mondes contemporains the anthropological research center of contemporary societies since the it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to single locale there has also been related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of

kimiya yi sa ādat the alchemy of happiness text on islamic philosophy and alchemy by the persian philosopher and mystic al ghazālī th century depiction of ouroboros from the alchemical treatise aurora consurgens th century zürich switzerland alchemy from arabic al kīmiyā is an ancient branch of natural philosophy philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout europe africa and asia originating in greco roman egypt in the first few centuries ce alchemists attempted to purify mature and perfect certain materials common aims were chrysopoeia the transmutation of base metals lead into noble metals particularly gold the creation of an elixir of immortality the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease and the development of an alkahest universal solvent the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and in the hellenistic and western mystery tradition the achievement of gnosis in europe the creation of philosopher stone was variously connected with all of these projects in english the term is often limited to descriptions of european alchemy but similar practices existed in the far east the indian subcontinent and the muslim world in europe following the th century renaissance produced by the translation of medieval islamic works on science and the rediscovery of aristotelian philosophy alchemists played significant role in early modern science particularly chemistry and medicine islamic and european alchemists developed structure of basic laboratory techniques theory terminology and experimental method some of which are still in use today however they continued antiquity belief in four elements and guarded their work in secrecy including cyphers and cryptic symbolism their work was guided by hermetic principles related to magic mythology and religion modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects despite the arguments of scholars like holmyard and von franz that they should be understood as complementary the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry medicine and charlatanism and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred the latter interests historians of esotericism psychologists and some philosophers and spiritualists the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts despite this split which von franz believes has existed since the western traditions origin in mix of greek philosophy that was mixed with egyptian and mesopotamian technology numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as pseudo democritus first century on physical and mystical matters although alchemy is popularly associated with magic historian lawrence principe argues that recent historical research has revealed that medieval and early modern alchemy embraced much more diverse set of ideas goals techniques and practices most readers probably are aware of several common claims about alchemy for example that it is akin to magic or that its practice then or now is essentially deceptive these ideas about alchemy emerged during the eighteenth century or after while each of them might have limited validity within narrow context none of them is an accurate depiction of alchemy in general etymology the word alchemy comes from old french alquemie alkimie used in medieval latin as alchymia this name was itself brought from the arabic word al kīmiyā or composed of two parts the late greek term khēmeía χημεία also spelled khumeia χυμεία and khēmía χημία and the arabic definite article al meaning the together this association can be interpreted as the process of transmutation by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form several etymologies have been proposed for the greek term the first was proposed by zosimos of panopolis rd th cent ce who derived it from the name of book the khemeu hermanm diels argued in that it rather derived from χύμα used to describe metallic objects formed by casting others trace its roots to the egyptian name kēme hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 khmi meaning black earth which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the nile valley as opposed to red desert sand according to the egyptologist wallis budge the arabic word al kīmiyaʾ actually means the egyptian science borrowing from the coptic word for egypt kēme or its equivalent in the mediaeval bohairic dialect of coptic khēme this coptic word derives from demotic kmỉ itself from ancient egyptian kmt the ancient egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour black egypt was the black land by contrast with the red land the surrounding desert so this etymology could also explain the nickname egyptian black arts history alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships one can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be mostly independent at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china and indian alchemy centered on the indian subcontinent and western alchemy which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center has shifted over the millennia from greco roman egypt to the islamic world and finally medieval europe chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths in contrast western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various western religions it is still an open question whether these three strands share common origin or to what extent they influenced each other hellenistic egypt zosimos from marcelin berthelot collection des anciens alchimistes grecs vol paris the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and hellenistic egypt where the city of alexandria was center of alchemical knowledge and retained its pre eminence through most of the greek and roman periods following the work of andré jean festugière modern scholars see alchemical practice in the roman empire as originating from the egyptian goldsmith art greek philosophy and different religious traditions tracing the origins of the alchemical art in egypt is complicated by the pseudepigraphic nature of texts from the greek alchemical corpus the treatises of zosimos of panopolis the earliest historically attested author fl ce can however help in situating the other authors zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors such as mary the jewess pseudo democritus and agathodaimon but very little is known about any of these authors the most complete of their works the four books of pseudo democritus were probably written in the first century ce recent scholarship tend to emphasizes the testimony of zosimus who traced the alchemical arts back to egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices it has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of greek philosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in systematic way zosimos of panopolis wrote in the final abstinence also known as the final count zosimos explains that the ancient practice of tinctures the technical greek name for the alchemical arts had been taken over by certain demons who taught the art only to those who offered them sacrifices since zosimos also called the demons gardians of places οἱ κατὰ τόπον ἔφοροι and those who offered them sacrifices priests ἱερέα it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of egypt and their priests while critical of the kind alchemy he associated with the egyptian priests and their followers zosimos nonetheless saw the tradition recent past as rooted in the rites of the egyptian temples mythology zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to pharaonic egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class though there is little to no evidence for his assertion alchemical writers used classical figures from greek roman and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets isis osiris jason and many others the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus or thrice great hermes his name is derived from the god thoth and his greek counterpart hermes hermes and his caduceus or serpent staff were among alchemy principal symbols according to clement of alexandria he wrote what were called the forty two books of hermes covering all fields of knowledge the hermetica of thrice great hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era technology the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy extending back to many writings were lost when the emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing revolt in alexandria few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus dating from they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones cleaning and fabricating pearls and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver these writings lack the mystical philosophical elements of alchemy but do contain the works of bolus of mendes or pseudo democritus which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements between the time of bolus and zosimos the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into hermetic art philosophy alexandria acted as melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism platonism stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemy character an important example of alchemy roots in greek philosophy originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire according to aristotle each element had sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are true alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present day sense of the word the four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity lactantius believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth st augustine later affirmed this in the th th centuries but also condemned trismegistus for idolatry examples of pagan christian and jewish alchemists can be found during this period most of the greco roman alchemists preceding zosimos are known only by pseudonyms such as moses isis cleopatra democritus and ostanes others authors such as komarios and chymes we only know through fragments of text after greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors by the middle of the th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the th and th centuries india the nd millennium bc text vedas describe connection between eternal life and gold considerable knowledge of metallurgy has been exhibited in th century text called arthashastra which provides ingredients of explosives agniyoga and salts extracted from fertile soils and plant remains yavakshara such as saltpetre nitre perfume making different qualities of perfumes are mentioned granulated refined sugar buddhist texts from the nd to th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold according to some scholars greek alchemy may have influenced indian alchemy but there are no hard evidences to back this claim the th century persian chemist and physician abū rayhān bīrūnī who visited gujarat as part of the court of mahmud of ghazni reported that they the goals of alchemy in india included the creation of divine body sanskrit divya deham and immortality while still embodied sanskrit jīvan mukti sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur that are homologized with the semen of the god śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess devī some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of matsyendranath other early writings are found in the jaina medical treatise kalyāṇakārakam of ugrāditya written in south india in the early th century two famous early indian alchemical authors were nāgārjuna siddha and nityanātha siddha nāgārjuna siddha was buddhist monk his book is an example of indian alchemy and medicine nityanātha siddha wrote rasaratnākara also highly influential work in sanskrit rasa translates to mercury and nāgārjuna siddha was said to have developed method of converting mercury into gold scholarship on indian alchemy is in the publication of the alchemical body by david gordon white modern bibliography on indian alchemical studies has been written by white the contents of sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in jan meulenbeld history of indian medical literature the discussion of these works in himl gives summary of the contents of each work their special features and where possible the evidence concerning their dating chapter of himl various works on rasaśāstra and ratnaśāstra or various works on alchemy and gems gives brief details of further six hundred and fifty five treatises in some cases meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles great deal remains to be discovered about indian alchemical literature the content of the sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy islamic world jabir ibn hayyan geber considered the father of chemistry introduced scientific and experimental approach to alchemy after the fall of the roman empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations the word alchemy itself was derived from the arabic word al kīmiyā الكيمياء the early islamic world was melting pot for alchemy platonic and aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated during the late th and early th centuries through syriac translations and scholarship in the late th century jābir ibn hayyān latinized as geber or geberus introduced new approach to alchemy based on scientific methodology and controlled experimentation in the laboratory in contrast to the ancient greek and egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible with very little concern for laboratory work jabir is thus considered by many to be the father of chemistry albeit others reserve that title for robert boyle or antoine lavoisier the science historian paul kraus wrote jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation early islamic chemists such as jabir ibn hayyan al kindi alkindus and muhammad ibn zakarīya al rāzi rasis or rhazes contributed number of key chemical discoveries such as the muriatic hydrochloric acid sulfuric and nitric acids and more the discovery that aqua regia mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids could dissolve the noblest metal gold was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir jabir ultimate goal was takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness according to jabir in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior for example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist thus jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal different metal would result by this reasoning the search for the philosopher stone was introduced to western alchemy jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of substance name in arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the element physical properties the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir his original system consisted of seven elements which included the five classical elements aether air earth fire and water in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties shortly thereafter this evolved into eight elements with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion mercury giving volatility and stability and salt giving solidity the atomic theory of where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles also has its origins in the work of jabir from the th to th centuries alchemical theories faced criticism from variety of practical muslim chemists including alkindus abū al rayhān al bīrūnī avicenna and ibn khaldun in particular they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals east asia taoist alchemists often use this alternate version of the taijitu whereas european alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals chinese alchemy had more obvious connection to medicine the philosopher stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists however in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosopher stone was often equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists as previously stated above chinese alchemy was more related to medicine it is said that the chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find potion for eternal life described in th century texts and used in fireworks in china by the th century it was used in cannons by from china the use of gunpowder spread to japan the mongols the muslim world and europe gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in and in europe by the th century chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion in the early song dynasty followers of this taoist idea chiefly the elite and upper class would ingest mercuric sulfide which though tolerable in low levels led many to suicide thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the taoist heavens the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources the aforementioned tai chi chuan mastering of the qi etc medieval europe the alchemist in search of the philosopher stone by joseph wright an illuminated page from book on alchemical processes and receipts ca th century the introduction of alchemy to latin europe may be dated to february with the completion of robert of chester translation of the arabic book of the composition of alchemy although european craftsmen and technicians preexisted robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in th century toledo spain through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath translations of the time included the turba philosophorum and the works of avicenna and al razi these brought with them many new words to the european vocabulary for which there was no previous latin equivalent alcohol carboy elixir and athanor are examples meanwhile theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought the th century st anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in christian context in the early th century peter abelard followed anselm work laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west in the early th century robert grosseteste used abelard methods of analysis and added the use of observation experimentation and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations grosseteste also did much work to reconcile platonic and aristotelian thinking through much of the th and th centuries alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations and new latin contributions were not made the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists in the th century albertus magnus and roger bacon were the most notable of these their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian terms albertus magnus dominican friar is known to have written works such as the book of minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes and democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna where they concerned the transmutation of metals from the time shortly after his death through to the th century more than alchemical tracts were misattributed to him common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist likewise alchemical texts have been attributed to albert student thomas aquinas roger bacon franciscan friar who wrote on wide variety of topics including optics comparative linguistics and medicine composed his great work for as part of project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time while alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy connections to soteriology and christian theology bacon writings integrated morality salvation alchemy and the prolongation of life his correspondence with clement highlighted this noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy like the greeks before him bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle the natural philosophers and all latin writers of his time the practical however confirmed the theoretical thought experiment and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine in later european legend however bacon became an archmage in particular along with albertus magnus he was credited with the forging of brazen head capable of answering its owner questions soon after bacon the influential work of pseudo geber sometimes identified as paul of taranto appeared his summa perfectionis remained staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur mercury theory and the unusual clarity with which they were described by the end of the th century alchemy had developed into fairly structured system of belief adepts believed in the macrocosm microcosm theories of hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body for example if one could learn the secret of purifying gold one could use the technique to purify the human soul they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated finally the alchemists practiced their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam by purifying the two parts of man soul man could be reunited with god in the th century alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves dante piers plowman and chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars pope john xxii edict spondent quas non exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo alchemists in henry iv of england banned the practice of multiplying metals although it was possible to buy licence to attempt to make gold alchemically and number were granted by henry vi and edward iv these critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy which continued with an increasingly christian tone the th century saw the christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of petrus bonus john of rupescissa and in works written in the name of raymond lull and arnold of villanova nicolas flamel is well known alchemist but good example of pseudepigraphy the practice of giving your works the name of someone else usually more famous although the historical flamel existed the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in flamel was not religious scholar as were many of his predecessors and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher stone his work spends great deal of time describing the processes and reactions but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him especially as regarded the philosopher stone through the th and th centuries alchemists were much like flamel they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone bernard trevisan and george ripley made similar contributions their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art renaissance and early modern europe page from alchemic treatise of ramon llull th century the red sun rising over the city the final illustration of th century alchemical text splendor solis the word rubedo meaning redness was adopted by alchemists and signalled alchemical success and the end of the great work during the renaissance hermetic and platonic foundations were restored to european alchemy the dawn of medical pharmaceutical occult and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed in the late th century marsilo ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into broader occult hermeticism fusing it with magic astrology and christian cabala key figure in this development was german heinrich cornelius agrippa who received his hermetic education in italy in the schools of the humanists in his de occulta philosophia he attempted to merge kabbalah hermeticism and alchemy he was instrumental in spreading this new blend of hermeticism outside the borders of italy philippus aureolus paracelsus theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim cast alchemy into new form rejecting some of agrippa occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote many have said of alchemy that it is for the making of gold and silver for me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm he took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of soul purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them paracelsian practical alchemy especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named spagyric synonym for alchemy from the greek words meaning to separate and to join together based on the latin alchemic maxim solve et coagula iatrochemistry also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by paracelsus john dee july december followed agrippa occult tradition although better known for angel summoning divination and his role as astrologer cryptographer and consultant to queen elizabeth dee alchemical monas hieroglyphica written in was his most popular and influential work his writing portrayed alchemy as sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the hermetic axiom as above so below during the th century short lived supernatural interpretation of alchemy became popular including support by fellows of the royal society robert boyle and elias ashmole proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of renaissance europe alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining medical services and the production of chemicals medicines metals and gemstones rudolf ii holy roman emperor in the late th century famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague including dee and his associate edward kelley king james iv of scotland julius duke of brunswick lüneburg henry duke of brunswick lüneburg augustus elector of saxony julius echter von mespelbrunn and maurice landgrave of hesse kassel all contracted alchemists john son arthur dee worked as court physician to michael of russia and charles of england but also compiled the alchemical book fasciculus chemicus alchemist sendivogius by jan matejko although most of these appointments were legitimate the trend of pseudo alchemical fraud continued through the renaissance betrüger would use sleight of hand or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations distinguishing themselves from the con artists false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud the terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period and the differences between alchemy chemistry and small scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day there were important overlaps between practitioners and trying to classify them into alchemists chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic for example tycho brahe an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations had laboratory built at his uraniborg observatory research institute michael sendivogius michał sędziwój polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in lab sometime around sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who in applied this in submarine isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy see isaac newton occult studies than he did to either optics or physics other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle and jan baptist van helmont their hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science later modern period robert boyle an alchemist pictured in charles mackay extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the th century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its peak in the th century as late as james price claimed to have produced powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit diversity of theories practices and purposes scholastic and anti aristotelian paracelsian and anti paracelsian hermetic neoplatonic mechanistic vitalistic and more plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof robert boyle pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the sun and moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the th and th centuries based on revolutionary discoveries of lavoisier and john dalton beginning around rigid distinction began to be drawn for the first time between alchemy and chemistry by the alchemy was now restricted to the realm of gold making leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans and the tradition itself nothing more than fraud in order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected academic writers during the th century scientific enlightenment attempted for the sake of survival to divorce and separate the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy this move was mostly successful and the consequences of this continued into the th th and st centuries during the occult revival of the early th century alchemy received new attention as an occult science the esoteric or occultist school which arose during the th century held and continues to hold the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in spiritual sense and it downplays the role of the alchemy as practical tradition or protoscience this interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual moral or mystical processes in the th century revival of alchemy the two most seminal figures were mary anne atwood and ethan allen hitchcock who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy both forwarded completely esoteric view of alchemy as atwood claimed no modern art or chemistry notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims has any thing in common with alchemy atwood work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi arthur edward waite and rudolf steiner hitchcock in his remarks upon alchymists attempted to make case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about spiritual discipline under materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state in baron carl reichenbach published his studies on odic force concept with some similarities to alchemy but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion in louis cattiaux published the message retrouvé work that was at once philosophical mystical and highly influenced by alchemy in his lineage many researchers including emmanuel and charles hooghvorst are updating alchemical studies in france and belgium women in alchemy several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy michael maier names mary the jewess cleopatra the alchemist medera and taphnutia as the four women who knew how to make the philosopher stone zosimos sister theosebia later known as euthica the arab and isis the prophetess also played role in early alchemical texts the first alchemist whose name we know is said to have been mary the jewess early sources claim that mary or maria devised number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes the laboratory water bath known eponymously especially in france as the bain marie is said to have been invented or at least improved by her essentially double boiler it was and is used in chemistry for processes that require gentle heating the tribikos modified distillation apparatus and the kerotakis more intricate apparatus used especially for sublimations are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her the occasional claim that mary was the first to discover hydrochloric acid is not accepted by most authorities although we have no writing from mary herself she is known from the early fourth century writings of zosimos of panopolis due to the proliferation of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women after the greco roman period women names appear less frequently in the alchemical literature women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods aside from the fictitious account of perenelle flamel mary anne atwood suggestive inquiry into the hermetic mystery marks their return during the nineteenth century occult revival modern historical research the history of alchemy has become significant and recognized subject of academic study as the language of the alchemists is analyzed historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history such as the evolution of science and philosophy the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism rosicrucianism and other mystic movements institutions involved in this research include the chymistry of isaac newton project at indiana university the university of exeter centre for the study of esotericism exeseso the european society for the study of western esotericism esswe and the university of amsterdam sub department for the history of hermetic philosophy and related currents large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the bibliotheca philosophica hermetica in amsterdam recipe found in mid th century kabbalah based book features step by step instructions on turning copper into gold the author attributed this recipe to an ancient manuscript he located journals which publish regularly on the topic of alchemy include ambix published by the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry and isis published by the history of science society core concepts mandala illustrating common alchemical concepts symbols and processes from spiegel der kunst und natur western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born concepts were imported from neoplatonism and earlier greek cosmology as such the classical elements appear in alchemical writings as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity similarly the gods of the roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature the concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosopher stone hermeticism in the eyes of variety of esoteric and hermetic practitioners alchemy is fundamentally spiritual transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation purification and perfection the writings attributed to hermes trismegistus are primary source of alchemical theory he is named alchemy founder and chief patron authority inspiration and guide early alchemists such as zosimos of panopolis ad highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest symbolic of religious regeneration of the human soul this approach continued in the middle ages as metaphysical aspects substances physical states and material processes were used as metaphors for spiritual entities spiritual states and ultimately transformation in this sense the literal meanings of alchemical formulas were blind hiding their true spiritual philosophy practitioners and patrons such as melchior cibinensis and pope innocent viii existed within the ranks of the church while martin luther applauded alchemy for its consistency with christian teachings both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral state toward perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state so the philosopher stone then represented mystic key that would make this evolution possible applied to the alchemist himself the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal in texts that are written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbols diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic works and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning in his alchemical catechism théodore henri de tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic magnum opus the great work of alchemy is often described as series of four stages represented by colors nigredo blackening or melanosis albedo whitening or leucosis citrinitas yellowing or xanthosis rubedo reddening purpling or iosis modern alchemy due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature and the th century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations those focusing on the exoteric such as historians of science lawrence principe and william newman have interpreted the decknamen or code words of alchemy as physical substances these scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts at the opposite end of the spectrum focusing on the esoteric scholars such as george calian and anna marie roos who question the reading of principe and newman interpret these same decknamen as spiritual religious or psychological concepts today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical movements groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism since the victorian revival of alchemy occultists reinterpreted alchemy as spiritual practice involving the self transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances which has contributed to merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought traditional medicine traditional medicine can use the concept of the transmutation of natural substances using pharmacological or combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques in ayurveda the samskaras are claimed to transform heavy metals and toxic herbs in way that removes their toxicity these processes are actively used to the present day spagyrists of the th century albert richard riedel and jean dubuis merged paracelsian alchemy with occultism teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods the schools they founded les philosophes de la nature and the paracelsus research society popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products the courses books organizations and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as new age medicinal practice psychology alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the swiss psychologist carl gustav jung initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images after being given copy of the translation of the secret of the golden flower chinese alchemical text by his friend richard wilhelm jung discovered direct correlation or parallels between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner symbolic images coming up in dreams visions or imaginations during the psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients process which he called process of individuation he regarded the alchemical images as symbols expressing aspects of this process of individuation of which the creation of the gold or lapis within were symbols for its origin and goal together with his alchemical mystica soror jungian swiss analyst marie louise von franz jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available compiled lexicon of key phrases with cross references and pored over them the volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of and renewed alchemy popularity as symbolic process of coming into wholeness as human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer spirit and matter are reunited in the hieros gamos or divine marriage his writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces archetypes that influence all of life both von franz and jung have contributed greatly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is volume of his collected works mysterium coniunctionis literature alchemy has had long standing relationship with art seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment literary alchemy appears throughout the history of english literature from shakespeare to rowling and also the popular japanese manga fullmetal alchemist here characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus in the th century chaucer began trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of terry pratchett visual artists had similar relationship with alchemy while some of them used alchemy as source of satire others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers in the last hundred years alchemists have been portrayed in magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction film television novels comics and video games modern science one goal of alchemy synthesizing gold is

the astronomer by johannes vermeer an astronomer is scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses their studies on specific question or field outside the scope of earth they observe astronomical objects such as stars planets moons comets and galaxies in either observational by analyzing the data or theoretical astronomy examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science solar astronomy the origin or evolution of stars or the formation of galaxies related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the universe as whole astronomers usually fall under either of two main types observational and theoretical observational astronomers make direct observations of celestial objects and analyze the data in contrast theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed because it takes millions to billions of years for system of stars or galaxy to complete life cycle astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form evolve and die they use these data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work further subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include planetary astronomy galactic astronomy or physical cosmology academic galileo is often referred to as the father of modern astronomy historically astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws today that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have phd in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities they spend the majority of their time working on research although they quite often have other duties such as teaching building instruments or aiding in the operation of an observatory the number of professional astronomers in the united states is actually quite small the american astronomical society which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america has approximately members this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics geology and engineering whose research interests are closely related to astronomy the international astronomical union comprises almost members from different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the phd level and beyond guy consolmagno vatican observatory analyzing meteorite contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through telescope through the dark hours of the night it is far more common to use charge coupled device ccd camera to record long deep exposure allowing more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time before ccds photographic plates were common method of observation modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just few weeks per year analysis of observed phenomena along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe takes the majority of observational astronomers time astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as public service to encourage interest in the field those who become astronomers usually have broad background in maths sciences and computing in high school taking courses that teach how to research write and present papers are also invaluable in college university most astronomers get phd in astronomy or physics emily lakdawalla at the planetary conference amateur astronomers while there is relatively low number of professional astronomers the field is popular among amateurs most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on regular basis and often host star parties the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from different nations like any hobby most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote few hours month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research however amateurs span the range from so called armchair astronomers to the very ambitious who own science grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research see also list of astronomers list of women astronomers list of muslim astronomers list of french astronomers list of hungarian

ascii abbreviated from american standard code for information interchange is character encoding standard for electronic communication ascii codes represent text in computers equipment and other devices most modern character encoding schemes are based on ascii although they support many additional characters the internet assigned numbers authority iana prefers the name us ascii for this character encoding ascii is one of the ieee milestones overview ascii was developed from telegraph code its first commercial use was as seven bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services work on the ascii standard began on october with the first meeting of the american standards association asa now the american national standards institute or ansi subcommittee the first edition of the standard was published in underwent major revision during and experienced its most recent update during compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting alphabetization of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters the use of ascii format for network interchange was described in that document was formally elevated to an internet standard in originally based on the english alphabet ascii encodes specified characters into seven bit integers as shown by the ascii chart above ninety five of the encoded characters are printable these include the digits to lowercase letters to uppercase letters to and punctuation symbols in addition the original ascii specification included non printing control codes which originated with teletype machines most of these are now obsolete although few are still commonly used such as the carriage return line feed and tab codes for example lowercase would be represented in the ascii encoding by binary hexadecimal is the ninth letter decimal history control pictures of equivalent controls are shown where they exist or grey dot otherwise the american standard code for information interchange ascii was developed under the auspices of committee of the american standards association asa called the committee by its later subcommittee and later by that subcommittee working group now incits the asa became the united states of america standards institute usasi and ultimately the american national standards institute ansi with the other special characters and control codes filled in ascii was published as asa leaving code positions without any assigned meaning reserved for future standardization and one unassigned control code there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet the indecision did not last long during may the ccitt working party on the new telegraph alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to sticks and and international organization for standardization tc sc voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standard the task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may meeting locating the lowercase letters in sticks and caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by single bit which simplified case insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers the committee made other changes including other new characters the brace and vertical bar characters renaming some control characters som became start of header soh and moving or removing others ru was removed ascii was subsequently updated as usas then usas ansi and finally ansi revisions of the ascii standard asa asa approved but not published nevertheless used by ibm display stations and ibm display control usas usas ansi ansi ansi ansi ansi incits ansi incits ansi incits ansi incits in the standard the committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted least significant bit first and how it should be recorded on perforated tape they proposed track standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some punched card formats design considerations bit width the subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems like other character encodings ascii specifies correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols graphemes and control characters this allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate character oriented information such as written language before ascii was developed the encodings in use included alphabetic characters numerical digits and from to special graphic symbols to include all these and control characters compatible with the comité consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ccitt international telegraph alphabet no ita standard of fieldata and early ebcdic more than codes were required for ascii ita were in turn based on the bit telegraph code émile baudot invented in and patented in the committee debated the possibility of shift function like in ita which would allow more than codes to be represented by six bit code in shifted code some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes it allows compact encoding but is less reliable for data transmission as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes long part of the transmission unreadable the standards committee decided against shifting and so ascii required at least seven bit code the committee considered an eight bit code since eight bits octets would allow two four bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary coded decimal however it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice the committee voted to use seven bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position it also allowed for parity bit for error checking if desired eight bit machines with octets as the native data type that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to in some printers the high bit was used to enable italics printing internal organization the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification the first two so called ascii sticks positions were reserved for control characters the space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier so it became position hex for the same reason many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits the committee decided it was important to support uppercase character alphabets and chose to pattern ascii so it could be reduced easily to usable character set of graphic codes as was done in the dec sixbit code lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase to keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters and the letter was placed in position hex to match the draft of the corresponding british standard the digits are prefixed with but the remaining bits correspond to their respective values in binary making conversion with binary coded decimal straightforward many of the non alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters not electric typewriters mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the remington no the first typewriter with shift key and the shifted values of were early typewriters omitted and using capital letter and lowercase letter instead but and pairs became standard once and became common thus in ascii were placed in the second stick positions corresponding to the digits in the adjacent stick the parentheses could not correspond to and however because the place corresponding to was taken by the space character this was accommodated by removing underscore from and shifting the remaining characters which corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with and this discrepancy from typewriters led to bit paired keyboards notably the teletype model which used the left shifted layout corresponding to ascii not to traditional mechanical typewriters electric typewriters notably the ibm selectric used somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers following the ibm pc especially model and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did the pair also dates to the no and the pairs were used on some keyboards others including the no did not shift comma or full stop so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting however ascii split the pair dating to no and rearranged mathematical symbols varied conventions commonly to some common characters were not included notably ½¼ while were included as diacritics for international use and for mathematical use together with the simple line characters in addition to common the symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented in the french variation so the was placed in position hex right before the letter the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message som end of address eoa end of message eom end of transmission eot who are you wru are you ru reserved device control dc synchronous idle sync and acknowledge ack these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns character order ascii code order is also called asciibetical order collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than standard alphabetical order collating sequence the main deviations in ascii order are all uppercase come before lowercase letters for example precedes digits and many punctuation marks come before letters an intermediate order converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values character groups control characters ascii reserves the first codes numbers decimal for control characters codes originally intended not to represent printable information but rather to control devices such as printers that make use of ascii or to provide meta information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape for example character represents the line feed function which causes printer to advance its paper and character represents backspace refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or white space as non whitespace control characters except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line oriented formatting ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within document other schemes such as markup languages address page and document layout and formatting the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional for example where character would be used slightly differently on terminal link than on data stream and sometimes accidental for example with the meaning of delete probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model asr which was printing terminal with an available paper tape reader punch option paper tape was very popular medium for long term program storage until the less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape in particular the teletype model machine assignments for codes control dc also known as xon control dc also known as xoff and delete became de facto standards the model was also notable for taking the description of control code bel meaning audibly alert the operator literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received bel character because the keytop for the key also showed left arrow symbol from ascii which had this character instead of underscore noncompliant use of code control shift in interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected when teletype asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received control xoff an abbreviation for transmit off it caused the tape reader to stop receiving control xon transmit on caused the tape reader to resume this technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as handshaking signal warning sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow it persists to this day in many systems as manual output control technique on some systems control retains its meaning but control is replaced by second control to resume output the asr also could be configured to employ control dc and control dc to start and stop the tape punch on some units equipped with this function the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively delete backspace the teletype could not move the head backwards so it did not put key on the keyboard to send bs backspace instead there was key marked that sent code del the purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in hand typed paper tape the operator had to push button on the tape punch to back it up then type the rubout which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with character that was intended to be ignored teletypes were commonly used for the less expensive computers from digital equipment corporation so these systems had to use the available key and thus the del code to erase the previous character because of this dec video terminals by default sent the del code for the key marked backspace while the key marked delete sent an escape sequence while many other terminals sent bs for the backspace key the unix terminal driver could only use one code to erase the previous character this could be set to bs or del but not both resulting in long period of annoyance where users had to correct it depending on what terminal they were using shells that allow line editing such as ksh bash and zsh understand both the assumption that no key sent bs caused control to be used for other purposes such as the help prefix command in gnu emacs escape many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones the escape character esc code for example was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning this is the same meaning of escape encountered in url encodings language strings and other systems where certain characters have reserved meaning over time this meaning has been co opted and has eventually been changed in modern use an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of command sequence usually in the form of so called ansi escape code or more properly control sequence introducer from ecma and its successors beginning with esc followed by left bracket character an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an out of band character used to terminate an operation as in the teco and vi text editors in graphical user interface gui and windowing systems esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit terminate altogether end of line the inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring plain text files between systems the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems teletype machines required that line of text be terminated with both carriage return which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line and line feed which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead the name carriage return comes from the fact that on manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary the entire carriage had to be pushed returned to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line dec operating systems os rt rsx rsts tops etc used both characters to mark the end of line so that the console device originally teletype machines would work by the time so called glass ttys later called crts or terminals came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention when gary kildall created cp he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in dec rt until the introduction of pc dos in ibm had no hand in this because their operating systems used ebcdic instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punch card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless ibm pc dos also marketed as ms dos by microsoft inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on cp and windows inherited it from ms dos unfortunately requiring two characters to mark the end of line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone to simplify matters plain text data streams including files on multics used line feed lf alone as line terminator unix and unix like systems and amiga systems adopted this convention from multics the original macintosh os apple dos and prodos on the other hand used carriage return cr alone as line terminator however since apple replaced these operating systems with the unix based macos operating system they now use line feed lf as well the radio shack trs also used lone cr to terminate lines computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops and tenex using cr lf line endings machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings and machines running operating systems such as os that represented lines as character count followed by the characters of the line and that used ebcdic rather than ascii the telnet protocol defined an ascii network virtual terminal nvt so that connections between hosts with different line ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting standard text format over the network telnet used ascii along with cr lf line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol including use of the network virtual terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for mail and the world wide web on systems not using the nvt cr lf line ending convention end of file stream the pdp monitor and its pdp successor tops used control sub as an end of file indication for input from terminal some operating systems such as cp tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used control to mark the end of the actual text in the file for these reasons eof or end of file was used colloquially and conventionally as three letter acronym for control instead of substitute the end of text code etx also known as control was inappropriate for variety of reasons while using as the control code to end file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as very convenient mnemonic aid historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx code convention to interrupt and halt program via an input data stream usually from keyboard in library and unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text strings such null terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz where here stands for zero binary oct dec hex abbreviation name null nul null som soh start

commercially during as seven bit teleprinter code for american telephone telegraph twx teletypewriter exchange network twx originally used the earlier five bit ita which was also used by the competing telex teleprinter system bob bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence his british colleague hugh mcgregor ross helped to popularize this work according to bemer so much so that the code that was to become ascii was first called the bemer ross code in europe because of his extensive work on ascii bemer has been called the father of ascii on march president lyndon johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii stating have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce luther hodges regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december when utf encoding surpassed it utf is backward compatible with ascii variants and derivations as computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of non english languages that used roman based alphabets one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions although some misuse that term to represent all variants including those that do not preserve ascii character map in the bit range furthermore the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii bit codes from early in its development ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso that are identical or nearly identical to ascii with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states such as the symbol for the united kingdom pound sterling almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii since ascii suited the needs of only the us and few other countries for example canada had its own version that supported french characters many other countries developed variants of ascii to include non english letters currency symbols etc see also yuscii yugoslavia it would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for national use however the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii and iso first acceptance of an international recommendation during caused ascii choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points iso iec like ascii is bit character set it does not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character code represented and in general text processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of iso iec german french or swedish etc programmer using their national variant of iso iec rather than ascii had to write and thus read something such as aäiü ön instead of ai trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ansi although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use many programmers kept their computers on us ascii so plain text in swedish german etc for example in mail or usenet contained and similar variants in the middle of words something those programmers got used to for example swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch could get jag har sm rg sar as the answer which should be nä jag har smörgåsar meaning no ve got sandwiches bit codes eventually as and bit and later bit computers began to replace and bit computers as the norm it became common to use an bit byte to store each character in memory providing an opportunity for extended bit relatives of ascii in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii leaving the original character mapping intact but adding additional character definitions after the first bit characters encodings include iscii india viscii vietnam although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii true ascii is defined strictly only by the ansi standard most early home computer systems developed their own bit character sets containing line drawing and game glyphs and often filled in some or all of the control characters from to with more graphics kaypro cp computers used the upper characters for the greek alphabet the petscii code commodore international used for their bit systems is probably unique among post codes in being based on ascii instead of the more common ascii such as found on the zx spectrum computer atari bit computers and galaksija computers also used ascii variants the ibm pc defined code page which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper positions operating systems such as dos supported these code pages and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set dec mcs for use in the popular vt terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript also defined set both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics more like modern character sets the iso iec standard derived from the dec mcs finally provided standard that most systems copied at least as accurately as they copied ascii but with many substitutions popular further extension designed by microsoft windows often mislabeled as iso added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing iso windows and the original bit ascii were the most common character encodings until when utf became more common iso iec introduced additional control codes defined in the hexadecimal range as part of extending the bit ascii encoding to become an bit system unicode unicode and the iso iec universal character set ucs have much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso iec and ascii rapidly in many environments while ascii is limited to characters unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification using natural numbers called code points and encoding to or bit binary formats called utf utf and utf ascii was incorporated into the unicode character set as the first symbols so the bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets this allows utf to be backward compatible with bit ascii as utf file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters even more importantly forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only bit ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set as is often done to support bit ascii extensions such as iso will preserve utf data unchanged see also ascii an asteroid named

animation is method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images in traditional animation images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film today most animations are made with computer generated imagery cgi computer animation can be very detailed animation while computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons low bandwidth or faster real time renderings other common animation methods apply stop motion technique to two and three dimensional objects like paper cutouts puppets or clay figures commonly the effect of animation is achieved by rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other the illusion as in motion pictures in general is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement but the exact causes are still uncertain analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope zoetrope flip book praxinoscope and film television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally for display on the computer techniques like animated gif and flash animation were developed animation is more pervasive than many people realize apart from short films feature films television series animated gifs and other media dedicated to the display of moving images animation is also prevalent in video games motion graphics user interfaces and visual effects the physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics in for instance moving images in magic lantern shows can also be considered animation the mechanical manipulation of three dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has very long history in automata electronic automata were popularized by disney as animatronics animators are artists who specialize in creating animation etymology the word animation stems from the latin animātiōn stem of animātiō meaning bestowing of life the primary meaning of the english word is liveliness and has been in use much longer than the meaning of moving image medium history before cinematography nr in the reworked second series of stampfer stroboscopic discs published by trentsensky vieweg in hundreds of years before the introduction of true animation people from all over the world enjoyed shows with moving figures that were created and manipulated manually in puppetry automata shadow play and the magic lantern the multi media phantasmagoria shows that were very popular in west european theatres from the late th century through the first half of the th century featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion projecting praxinoscope from here shown superimposing an animated figure on separately projected background scene in the stroboscopic disc better known as the phénakisticope introduced the principle of modern animation with sequential images that were shown one by one in quick succession to form an optical illusion of motion pictures series of sequential images had occasionally been made over thousands of years but the stroboscopic disc provided the first method to represent such images in fluent motion and for the first time had artists creating series with proper systematic breakdown of movements the stroboscopic animation principle was also applied in the zoetrope the flip book and the praxinoscope the average th century animation contained about images that were displayed as continuous loop by spinning device manually the flip book often contained more pictures and had beginning and end but its animation would not last longer than few seconds the first to create much longer sequences seems to have been charles émile reynaud who between and had much success with his to minute long pantomimes lumineuses silent era when cinematography eventually broke through in after animated pictures had been known for decades the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment animation on film was not commercialized until few years later by manufacturers of optical toys with film loops often traced from live action footage for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to use at home it would take some more years before animation reached movie theatres after earlier experiments by movie pioneers stuart blackton arthur melbourne cooper segundo de chomón and edwin porter among others blackton the haunted hotel was the first huge stop motion success baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves in full photographic detail without signs of any known stage trick fantasmagorie by émile cohl émile cohl fantasmagorie is the oldest known example of what became known as traditional hand drawn animation other great artistic and very influential short films were created by ladislas starevich with his puppet animations since and by winsor mccay with detailed drawn animation in films such as little nemo and gertie the dinosaur during the the production of animated cartoons became an industry in the us successful producer john randolph bray and animator earl hurd patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century felix the cat who debuted in became the first animated superstar golden age of us animation in steamboat willie featuring mickey mouse and minnie mouse popularized film with synchronized sound and put walt disney studio at the forefront of the animation industry in disney also introduced the innovation of full colour in flowers and trees as part of three year long exclusive deal with technicolor the enormous success of mickey mouse is seen as the start of the golden age of american animation that would last until the the united states dominated the world market of animation with plethora of cel animated theatrical shorts several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers including walt disney productions goofy and donald duck warner bros cartoons looney tunes characters like daffy duck bugs bunny tweety sylvester the cat wile coyote and road runner fleischer studios paramount cartoon studios betty boop popeye superman and casper mgm cartoon studio tom and jerry and droopy walter lantz productions universal studio cartoons woody woodpecker terrytoons th century fox mighty mouse and united artists pink panther animated features before cgi italian argentine cartoonist quirino cristiani showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character el peludo based on president yrigoyen patented in for the realization of his films including the world first animated feature film el apóstol in italian argentine director quirino cristiani made the first feature length film el apóstol now lost which became critical and commercial success it was followed by cristiani sin dejar rastros in but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government after working on it for three years lotte reiniger released the german feature length silhouette animation die abenteuer des prinzen achmed in the oldest extant animated feature in walt disney studios premiered their first animated feature snow white and the seven dwarfs still one of the highest grossing traditional animation features the fleischer studios followed this example in with gulliver travels with some success partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the second world war disney next features pinocchio fantasia both and fleischer studios second animated feature mr bug goes to town failed at the box office for decades afterwards disney would be the only american studio to regularly produce animated features until ralph bakshi became the first to also release more than handful features sullivan bluth studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with an american tail in although relatively few titles became as successful as disney features other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in wide variety of styles relatively often including stop motion and cutout animation techniques russia soyuzmultfilm animation studio founded in produced films including shorts per year on average and reached titles in china czechoslovakia czech republic italy france and belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films while japan became true powerhouse of animation production with its own recognizable and influential anime style of effective limited animation animation on television animation became very popular on television since the when television sets started to become common in most developed countries cartoons were mainly programmed for children on convenient time slots and especially us youth spent many hours watching saturday morning cartoons many classic cartoons found new life on the small screen and by the end of the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to tv series hanna barbera productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series such as the flintstones the first prime time animated series scooby doo since and belgian co production the smurfs the constraints of american television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late and in the early with hit series such as the simpsons since as part of renaissance of american animation while us animated series also spawned successes internationally many other countries produced their own child oriented programming relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation japanese anime tv series became very successful internationally since the and european producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co productions with japanese studios resulting in hit series such as barbapapa the netherlands japan france wickie und die starken männer 小さなバイキング ビッケ vicky the viking austria germany japan and il était une fois once upon time france japan switch from cel animation to computer animation computer animation was gradually developed since the wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the with an early short appearance in the sci fi thriller futureworld the rescuers down under was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without camera it was produced in style that very similar to traditional cel animation on the computer animation production system caps developed by the walt disney company in collaboration with pixar in the late the so called style more often associated with computer animation has become extremely popular since pixar toy story the first computer animated feature in this style most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the as it proved cheaper and more profitable not only the very popular animation style was generated with computers but also most of the films and series with more traditional hand crafted appearance in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects economic status in the animation market was worth us billion animated feature length films returned the highest gross margins around of all film genres between and animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early education propaganda and commercials the clarity of animation makes it powerful tool for instruction while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality it has therefore been widely for other purposed than mere entertainment during world war ii animation was widely exploited for propaganda many american studios including warner bros and disney lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey the public of certain war values some countries including china japan and the united kingdom produced their first feature length animation for their war efforts animation has been very popular in television commercials both due to its graphic appeal and the humour it can provide some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades such as snap crackle and pop in advertisements for kellogg cereals the legendary animation director tex avery was the producer of the first raid kills bugs dead commercials in which were very successful for the company spin off enterprises other media merchandise and theme parks apart from their success in movie theaters and television series many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media animation has traditionally been very closely related to comic books while many comic book characters found their way to the screen which is often the case in japan where many manga are adapted into anime original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines somewhat similarly characters and plots for video games an interactive animation medium have been derived from films and vice versa some of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media stories and images can easily be adapted into children books and other printed media songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media while very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media the walt disney company is the best known and most extreme example since first being licensed for children writing tablet in their mickey mouse mascot has been depicted on an enormous amount of products as have many other disney characters this may have influenced some pejorative use of mickey name but licensed disney products sell well and the so called disneyana has many avid collectors and even dedicated disneyana fanclub since disneyland opened in and features many attractions that were based on disney cartoon characters its enormous success spawned several other disney theme parks and resorts disney earnings from the theme parks has relatively often been higher than those from their movies criticism criticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception with its popularity large amount of criticism has arisen especially animated feature length films many concerns of cultural representation psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture awards as with any other form of media animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field the original awards for animation were presented by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences for animated shorts from the year during the th academy awards function the first winner of the academy award was the short flowers and trees production by walt disney productions the academy award for feature length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year and awarded during the th academy awards in it was won by the film shrek produced by dreamworks and pacific data images disney animation and pixar has produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award beauty and the beast was the first animated film nominated for best picture up and toy story also received best picture nominations after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten academy award for best animated feature academy award for best animated short film several other countries have instituted an award for the best animated feature film as part of their national film awards africa movie academy award for best animation since bafta award for best animated film since césar award for best animated film since golden rooster award for best animation since goya award for best animated film since japan academy prize for animation of the year since national film award for best animated film since also since the asia pacific screen award for best animated feature film has been awarded at the asia pacific screen awards since the european film awards have awarded the european film award for best animated film the annie award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation unlike the academy awards the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavour they were re organized in to create new field for best animated feature the winners were dominated by walt disney however newer studios led by pixar dreamworks have now begun to consistently vie for this award the list of awardees is as follows annie award for best animated feature annie award for best animated short subject annie award for best animated television production production joy heron featured video the creation of non trivial animation works longer than few seconds has developed as form of filmmaking with certain unique aspects traits common to both live action and animated feature length films are labor intensity and high production costs the most important difference is that once film is in the production phase the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live action films it is relatively easy for director to ask for one more take during principal photography of live action film but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation it is pointless for studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating visually dazzling five minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film thus animation studios starting with disney began the practice in the of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as whole while live action films are now also storyboarded they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards real time improvisation another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain film consistency from start to finish even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger animators like all artists necessarily have individual styles but must subordinate their individuality in consistent way to whatever style is employed on particular film since the early teams of about to people of whom to are animators typically have created feature length animated films it is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult this problem is usually solved by having separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions posed in different positions and viewed from different angles on traditionally animated projects maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles unlike live action films animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film in the early animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays while also continuing to use story departments and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late techniques traditional animation an example of traditional animation horse animated by rotoscoping from eadweard muybridge th century photos traditional animation also called cel animation or hand drawn animation was the process used for most animated films of the th century the individual frames of traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings first drawn on paper to create the illusion of movement each drawing differs slightly from the one before it the animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings the completed character cels are photographed one by one against painted background by rostrum camera onto motion picture film the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the st century today animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into computer system various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects the final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media including traditional mm film and newer media with digital video the look of traditional cel animation is still preserved and the character animators work has remained essentially the same over the past years some animation producers have used the term tradigital play on the words traditional and digital to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology examples of traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio united states animal farm united kingdom lucky and zorba italy and the illusionist british french traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include the lion king us the prince of egypt us akira japan spirited away japan the triplets of belleville france and the secret of kells irish french belgian full animation full animation refers to the process of producing high quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement having smooth animation fully animated films can be made in variety of styles from more realistically animated works like those produced by the walt disney studio the little mermaid beauty and the beast aladdin the lion king to the more cartoon styles of the warner bros animation studio many of the disney animated features are examples of full animation as are non disney works the secret of nimh us the iron giant us and nocturna spain fully animated films are animated at frames per second with combination of animation on ones and twos meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of or two frames out of limited animation limited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually choppy or skippy movement animation limited animation uses fewer drawings per second thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation this is more economic technique pioneered by the artists at the american studio united productions of america limited animation can be used as method of stylized artistic expression as in gerald mcboing boing us yellow submarine uk and certain anime produced in japan its primary use however has been in producing cost effective animated content for media for television the work of hanna barbera filmation and other tv animation studios and later the internet web cartoons rotoscoping rotoscoping is technique patented by max fleischer in where animators trace live action movement frame by frame the source film can be directly copied from actors outlines into animated drawings as in the lord of the rings us or used in stylized and expressive manner as in waking life us and scanner darkly us some other examples are fire and ice us heavy metal and aku no hana live action animation live action animation is technique combining hand drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots one of the earlier uses was in koko the clown when koko was drawn over live action footage walt disney and ub iwerks created series of alice comedies in which live action girl enters an animated world other examples include allegro non troppo italy who framed roger rabbit us volere volare italy space jam us and osmosis jones us stop motion animation stop motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real world objects and photographing them one frame of film at time to create the illusion of movement there are many different types of stop motion animation usually named after the medium used to create the animation computer software is widely available to create this type of animation traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time consuming to produce than current computer animation puppet animation typically involves stop motion puppet figures interacting in constructed environment in contrast to real world interaction in model animation the puppets generally have an armature inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints examples include the tale of the fox france the nightmare before christmas us corpse bride us coraline us the films of jiří trnka and the adult animated sketch comedy television series robot chicken us present puppetoon created using techniques developed by george pal are puppet animated films that typically use different version of puppet for different frames rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet finnish television commercial clay animation or plasticine animation often called claymation which however is trademarked name uses figures made of clay or similar malleable material to create stop motion animation the figures may have an armature or wire frame inside similar to the related puppet animation below that can be manipulated to pose the figures alternatively the figures may be made entirely of clay in the films of bruce bickford where clay creatures morph into variety of different shapes examples of clay animated works include the gumby show us mio mao italy morph shorts uk wallace and gromit shorts uk as of jan švankmajer dimensions of dialogue czechoslovakia the trap door uk films include wallace gromit the curse of the were rabbit chicken run and the adventures of mark twain strata cut animation strata cut animation is most commonly form of clay animation in which long bread like loaf of clay internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery is sliced into thin sheets with the animation camera taking frame of the end of the loaf for each cut eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within cutout animation is type of stop motion animation produced by moving two dimensional pieces of material paper or cloth examples include terry gilliam animated sequences from monty python flying circus uk fantastic planet france czechoslovakia tale of tales russia the pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series and sometimes in episodes of south park us and the music video live for the moment from verona riots band produced by alberto serrano and nívola uyá spain silhouette animation is variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes examples include the adventures of prince achmed weimar republic and princes et princesses france model animation refers to stop motion animation created to interact with and exist as part of live action world intercutting matte effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop motion characters or objects with live actors and settings examples include the work of ray harryhausen as seen in films jason and the argonauts and the work of willis brien on films king kong go motion is variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create motion blur between frames of film which is not present in traditional stop motion the technique was invented by industrial light magic and phil tippett to create special effect scenes for the film the empire strikes back another example is the dragon named vermithrax from film dragonslayer object animation refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop motion animation as opposed to specially created items graphic animation uses non drawn flat visual graphic material photographs newspaper clippings magazines etc which are sometimes manipulated frame by frame to create movement at other times the graphics remain stationary while the stop motion camera is moved to create on screen action brickfilm are subgenre of object animation involving using lego or other similar brick toys to make an animation these have had recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites youtube and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software pixilation involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters this allows for number of surreal effects including disappearances and reappearances allowing people to appear to slide across the ground and other effects examples of pixilation include the secret adventures of tom thumb and angry kid shorts and the academy award winning neighbours by norman mclaren computer animation computer animation encompasses variety of techniques the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on computer animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact animation can create images that seem real to the viewer animation animation of two circles joined by chain animation figures are created or edited on the computer using bitmap graphics and vector graphics this includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques interpolated morphing onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping animation has many applications including analog computer animation flash animation and powerpoint animation cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated final line advection animation is technique used in animation to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department speaking about using this approach in paperman john kahrs said that our animators can change things actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want and change the profile of the arm animation animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator the animator usually starts by creating polygon mesh to manipulate mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces which give the visual appearance of form to object or environment sometimes the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices this process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with key frames to create movement other techniques can be applied mathematical functions gravity particle simulations simulated fur or hair and effects fire and water simulations these techniques fall under the category of dynamics terms cel shaded animation is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software shading looks stark with less blending of colors examples include skyland france the iron giant united states futurama fox appleseed ex machina japan the legend of zelda the wind waker japan the legend of zelda breath of the wild japan machinima films created by screen capturing in video games and virtual worlds the term originated from the software introduction in the demoscene as well as the recordings of the first person shooter video game quake motion capture is used when live action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into cg characters examples include polar express us beowulf us christmas carol us the adventures of tintin us kochadiiyan india computer animation is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life using advanced rendering that mimics in detail skin plants water fire clouds etc examples include up us how to train your dragon us physically based animation is animation using computer simulations mechanical animation animatronics is the use of mechatronics to create machines that seem animate rather than robotic audio animatronics and autonomatronics is form of robotics animation combined with animation created by walt disney imagineering for shows and attractions at disney theme parks move and make noise generally recorded speech or song they are fixed to whatever supports them they can sit and stand and they cannot walk an audio animatron is different from an android type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds rather than responding to external stimuli in disney created an interactive version of the technology called autonomatronics linear animation generator is form of animation by using static picture frames installed in tunnel or shaft the animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in linear motion parallel to the installed picture frames the concept and the technical solution were invented in by mihai girlovan in romania chuckimation is type of animation created by the makers of the television series action league now in which characters props are thrown or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands the magic lantern used mechanical slides to project moving images probably since christiaan huygens invented this early image projector in other animation styles techniques and approaches world of color hydrotechnics at disney california adventure creates illusion of motion using fountains with high definition projections on mist screens hydrotechnics technique that includes lights water fire fog and lasers with high definition projections on mist screens drawn on film animation technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on film stock for example by norman mclaren len lye and stan brakhage paint on glass animation technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying oil paints on sheets of glass for example by aleksandr petrov erasure animation technique using traditional media photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image for example william kentridge is famous for his charcoal erasure films and piotr dumała for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster pinscreen animation makes use of screen filled with movable pins that can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen the screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows the technique has been used to create animated films with range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation sand animation sand is moved around on back or front lighted piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film this creates an interesting effect when animated because of the light contrast flip

apollo is one of the olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology the national divinity of the greeks apollo has been recognized as god of archery music and dance truth and prophecy healing and diseases the sun and light poetry and more one of the most important and complex of the greek gods he is the son of zeus and leto and the twin brother of artemis goddess of the hunt seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the kouros ephebe or beardless athletic youth apollo is considered to be the most greek of all the gods apollo is known in greek influenced etruscan mythology as apulu as the patron deity of delphi apollo pythios apollo is an oracular god the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil various epithets call him the averter of evil delphic apollo is the patron of seafarers foreigners and the protector of fugitives and refugees medicine and healing are associated with apollo whether through the god himself or mediated through his son asclepius apollo delivered people from epidemics yet he is also god who could bring ill health and deadly plague with his arrows the invention of archery itself is credited to apollo and his sister artemis apollo is usually described as carrying golden bow and quiver of silver arrows apollo capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona as the protector of young kourotrophos apollo is concerned with the health and education of children he presided over their passage into adulthood long hair which was the prerogative of boys was cut at the coming of age ephebeia and dedicated to apollo apollo is an important pastoral deity and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds protection of herds flocks and crops from diseases pests and predators were his primary duties on the other hand apollo also encouraged founding new towns and establishment of civil constitution he is associated with dominion over colonists he was the giver of laws and his oracles were consulted before setting laws in city as the god of mousike art of muses apollo presides over all music songs dance and poetry he is the inventor of string music and the frequent companion of the muses functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations the lyre is common attribute of apollo in hellenistic times especially during the th century bce as apollo helios he became identified among greeks with helios titan god of the sun in latin texts however there was no conflation of apollo with sol among the classical latin poets until st century ce apollo and helios sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the th century ce etymology apollo seated with lyre porphyry and marble nd century ad farnese collection naples italy alt px apollo attic ionic and homeric greek apollōn doric apellōn arcadocypriot apeilōn aeolic aploun the name apollo unlike the related older name paean is generally not found in the linear mycenean greek texts although there is possible attestation in the lacunose form pe rjo linear on the kn tablet the etymology of the name is uncertain the spelling in classical attic had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era but the doric form apellon is more archaic as it is derived from an earlier it probably is cognate to the doric month apellaios and the offerings apellaia at the initiation of the young men during the family festival apellai according to some scholars the words are derived from the doric word apella which originally meant wall fence for animals and later assembly within the limits of the square apella is the name of the popular assembly in sparta corresponding to the ecclesia beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested pre greek proto form apalyun several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors thus the greeks most often associated apollo name with the greek verb apollymi to destroy plato in cratylus connects the name with apolysis redemption with apolousis purification and with haploun simple in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name and finally with aeiballon ever shooting hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric apella which means assembly so that apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation sekos fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds in the ancient macedonian language pella means stone and some toponyms may be derived from this word pella the capital of ancient macedonia and pellēnē pallene number of non greek etymologies have been suggested for the name the hittite form apaliunas is attested in the manapa tarhunta letter perhaps related to hurrian and certainly the etruscan aplu god of plague in turn likely from akkadian aplu enlil meaning simply the son of enlil title that was given to the god nergal who was linked to shamash babylonian god of the sun the role of apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of apollo smintheus mouse apollo by chryses the trojan priest of apollo with the purpose of sending plague against the greeks the reasoning behind god of the plague becoming god of healing is apotropaic meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague the hittite testimony reflects an early form which may also be surmised from comparison of cypriot with doric the name of the lydian god qλdãns kʷʎðãns may reflect an earlier kʷalyán before palatalization syncope and the pre lydian sound change note the labiovelar in place of the labial found in pre doric ἀπέλjων and hittite apaliunas luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo the one of entrapment perhaps in the sense of hunter greco roman epithets apollo chief epithet was phoebus phoibos literally bright it was very commonly used by both the greeks

especially of the eyes apollo virotutis benefactor of mankind apollo virotutis was worshipped among other places at fins annecy haute savoie and at jublains maine et loire origins the omphalos in the museum of delphi the cult centers of apollo in greece delphi and delos date from the th century bce the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis apollo twin sister at delphi apollo was venerated as the slayer of pytho for the greeks apollo was all the gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods in archaic greece he was the prophet the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing in classical greece he was the god of light and of music but in popular religion he had strong function to keep away evil walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship which he termed dorian northwest greek component cretan minoan component and syro hittite component from his eastern origin apollo brought the art of inspection of symbols and omina σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα sēmeia kai terata and of the observation of the omens of the days the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced from anatolia the ritualism belonged to apollo from the beginning the greeks created the legalism the supervision of the orders of the gods and the demand for moderation and harmony apollo became the god of shining youth ideal beauty fine arts philosophy moderation spiritual life the protector of music divine law and perceptible order the improvement of the old anatolian god and his elevation to an intellectual sphere may be considered an achievement of the greek people healer and god protector from evil the function of apollo as healer is connected with paean the physician of the gods in the iliad who seems to come from more primitive religion paeοn is probably connected with the mycenaean pa ja wo ne linear but this is not certain he did not have separate cult but he was the personification of the holy magic song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease later the greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song paean the magicians were also called seer doctors and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god apollo at the oracles in the iliad apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the vedic god of disease rudra he sends plague to the achaeans the god who sends disease can also prevent it therefore when it stops they make purifying ceremony and offer him hecatomb to ward off evil when the oath of his priest appeases they pray and with song they call their own god the paean some common epithets of apollo as healer are paion literally healer or helper epikourios succouring oulios healer baleful and loimios of the plague in classical times his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil and was therefore called apotropaios averting evil and alexikakos keeping off ill from in later writers the word usually spelled paean becomes mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as god of healing homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus to apollo helios to apollo son asclepius the healer about the th century bce the paean became merely formula of adulation its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered it was in this way that apollo had become recognized as the god of music apollo role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory hence it became the roman custom for paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when fleet left the harbour and also after victory had been won dorian origin apollo victorious over the python by the florentine pietro francavilla dated depicting apollo first triumph when he slew with his bow and arrows the serpent python which lies dead at his feet the walters art museum the connection with the dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars the family festival was dedicated to apollo doric apellaios is the month of these rites and apellon is the megistos kouros the great kouros however it can explain only the doric type of the name which is connected with the ancient macedonian word pella pella stone stones played an important part in the cult of the god especially in the oracular shrine of delphi omphalos the homeric hymn represents apollo as northern intruder his arrival must have occurred during the dark ages that followed the destruction of the mycenaean civilization and his conflict with gaia mother earth was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent python the earth deity had power over the ghostly world and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle the older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated female dragon named delphyne cf womb and male serpent typhon from to smoke the adversary of zeus in the titanomachy who the narrators confused with python python was the good daemon ἀγαθὸς δαίμων of the temple as it appears in minoan religion but she was represented as dragon as often happens in northern european folklore as well as in the east apollo and his sister artemis can bring death with their arrows the conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings or magicians is common in germanic and norse mythology in greek mythology artemis was the leader hegemon of the nymphs who had similar functions with the nordic elves the elf shot originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves but it was later attested denoting stone arrow heads which were used by witches to harm people and also for healing rituals the vedic rudra has some similar functions with apollo the terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of shiva rudra could bring diseases with his arrows but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiva is healer physician god however the indo european component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens exorcisms and with the oracular cult minoan origin minoan labrys it seems an oracular cult existed in delphi from the mycenaean age in historical times the priests of delphi were called lab yadai the double axe men which indicates minoan origin the double axe labrys was the holy symbol of the cretan labyrinth the homeric hymn adds that apollo appeared as dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi where they evidently transferred their religious practices apollo delphinios or delphidios was sea god especially worshiped in crete and in the islands apollo sister artemis who was the greek goddess of hunting is identified with britomartis diktynna the minoan mistress of the animals in her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the master of the animals male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute his original name is unknown but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular apollo who stood by the virgin mistress of the animals becoming her brother the old oracles in delphi seem to be connected with local tradition of the priesthood and there is not clear evidence that kind of inspiration prophecy existed in the temple this led some scholars to the conclusion that pythia carried on the rituals in consistent procedure through many centuries according to the local tradition in that regard the mythical seeress sibyl of anatolian origin with her ecstatic art looks unrelated to the oracle itself however the greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel leaves which seem to be confirmed by recent studies plato describes the priestesses of delphi and dodona as frenzied women obsessed by mania frenzy greek word he connected with mantis prophet frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the near east as mari in the second millennium bc although crete had contacts with mari from bc there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the minoan and mycenean ages it is more probable that this art was introduced later from anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to delphi and dormant in several areas of greece anatolian origin illustration of coin of apollo agyieus from ambracia non greek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship the name of apollo mother leto has lydian origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia which is the origin of sibyl and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old assyro babylonian texts and these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites in hittite text is mentioned that the king invited babylonian priestess for certain purification similar story is mentioned by plutarch he writes that the cretan seer epimenides purified athens after the pollution brought by the alcmeonidae and that the seer expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to solon in his reform of the athenian state the story indicates that epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of asia and proves together with the homeric hymn that crete had resisting religion up to historical times it seems that these rituals were dormant in greece and they were reinforced when the greeks migrated to anatolia homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans fighting against the achaeans during the trojan war he is pictured as terrible god less trusted by the greeks than other gods the god seems to be related to appaliunas tutelary god of wilusa troy in asia minor but the word is not complete the stones found in front of the gates of homeric troy were the symbols of apollo western anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of artimus artemis and qλdãns whose name may be cognate with the hittite and doric forms in surviving lydian texts however recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of qλdãns with apollo the greeks gave to him the name agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was tapered stone or column however while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon all the feasts of apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month and the emphasis given to that day sibutu indicates babylonian origin the late bronze age from to bce hittite and hurrian aplu was god of plague invoked during plague years here we have an apotropaic situation where god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it aplu meaning the son of was title given to the god nergal who was linked to the babylonian god of the sun shamash homer interprets apollo as terrible god who brings death and disease with his arrows but who can also heal possessing magic art that separates him from the other greek gods in iliad his priest prays to apollo smintheus the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats all these functions including the function of the healer god paean who seems to have mycenean origin are fused in the cult of apollo oracular cult temple of apollo at delphi greece oracular tripod unusually among the olympic deities apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence delos and delphi in cult practice delian apollo and pythian apollo the apollo of delphi were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality lycia was sacred to the god for this apollo was also called lycian apollo cult was already fully established when written sources commenced about bce apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites in the nd and rd century ce those at didyma and claros pronounced the so called theological oracles in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all encompassing highest deity in the rd century apollo fell silent julian the apostate tried to revive the delphic oracle but failed oracular shrines delos lions apollo had famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in claros and didyma his oracular shrine in abae in phocis where he bore the toponymic epithet abaeus apollon abaios was important enough to be consulted by croesus his oracular shrines include abae in phocis bassae in the peloponnese at clarus on the west coast of asia minor as at delphi holy spring which gave off pneuma from which the priests drank in corinth the oracle of corinth came from the town of tenea from prisoners supposedly taken in the trojan war at khyrse in troad the temple was built for apollo smintheus in delos there was an oracle to the delian apollo during summer the hieron sanctuary of apollo adjacent to the sacred lake was the place where the god was said to have been born in delphi the pythia became filled with the pneuma of apollo said to come from spring inside the adyton in didyma an oracle on the coast of anatolia south west of lydian luwian sardis in which priests from the lineage of the branchidae received inspiration by drinking from healing spring located in the temple was believed to have been founded by branchus son or lover of apollo in hierapolis bambyce syria modern manbij according to the treatise de dea syria the sanctuary of the syrian goddess contained robed and bearded image of apollo divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image at patara in lycia there was seasonal winter oracle of apollo said to have been the place where the god went from delos as at delphi the oracle at patara was woman in segesta in sicily oracles were also given by sons of apollo in oropus north of athens the oracle amphiaraus was said to be the son of apollo oropus also had sacred spring in labadea east of delphi trophonius another son of apollo killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle temples of apollo many temples were dedicated to apollo in greece and the greek colonies they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of the greek architecture which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations some of the earliest temples especially in crete do not belong to any greek order it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures the different wooden elements were considered divine and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances the temples should be canonic and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings the first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics the doric order dominated during the th and the th century bc but there was mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs which couldn be solved without changing the original forms the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of temple both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome the most important temples are greek temples thebes greece the oldest temple probably dedicated to apollo ismenius was built in the th century it seems that it was curvilinear building the doric temple was built in the early th century but only some small parts have been found festival called daphnephoria was celebrated every ninth year in honour of apollo ismenius or galaxius the people held laurel branches daphnai and at the head of the procession walked youth chosen priest of

remains were discovered in the th century and many of its architectural fragments were dispersed among private collections or reworked into new sculptures parts of the temple podium were rediscovered in mythology apollo appears often in the myths plays and hymns as zeus favorite son apollo had direct access to the mind of zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans divinity beyond human comprehension he appears both as beneficial and wrathful god birth leto with her children by william henry rinehart apollo was the son of zeus the king of the gods and leto his previous wife or one of his mistresses growing up apollo was nursed by the nymphs korythalia and aletheia the personification of truth when zeus wife hera discovered that leto was pregnant she banned leto from giving birth on terra firma leto sought shelter in many lands only to be rejected by them finally the voice of unborn apollo informed his mother about floating island named delos which had once been asteria leto own sister since it was neither mainland nor an island leto was readily welcomed there and gave birth to her children under palm tree all the goddesses except hera were present to witness the event it is also stated that hera kidnapped eileithyia the goddess of childbirth to prevent leto from going into labor the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her necklace of amber yards or meters long leto holding apollo by lazar widmann when apollo was born clutching golden sword everything on delos turned into gold and the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance swans circled the island seven times and the nymphs sang in delight he was washed clean by the goddesses who then covered him in white garment and fastened golden bands around him since leto was unable to feed the him themis the goddess of divine law fed him with nectar or ambrosia upon tasting the divine food apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of lyre and archery and interpret the will of zeus to humankind zeus who had calmed hera by the time came and adorned his son with golden headband leto with apollo and artemis by francesco pozzi apollo birth fixed the floating delos to the earth leto promised that her son would be always favorable towards the delians according to some apollo secured delos to the bottom of the ocean after some time this island became sacred to apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god apollo was born on the seventh day hebdomagenes of the month thargelion according to delian tradition or of the month bysios according to delphian tradition the seventh and twentieth the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him mythographers agree that artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of apollo or that artemis was born on the island of ortygia and that she helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo hyperborea hyperborea the mystical land of eternal spring venerated apollo above all the gods the hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted pythian games there vast forest of beautiful trees was called the garden of apollo apollo spent the winter months among the hyperboreans his absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death no prophecies were issued during this time he returned to the world during the beginning of the spring the theophania festival was held in delphi to celebrate his return it is said that leto came to delos from hyperborea accompanied by pack of wolves henceforth hyperborea became apollo winter home and wolves became sacred to him his intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet lyceus meaning wolf like but apollo was also the wolf slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators the hyperborean worship of apollo bears the strongest marks of apollo being worshipped as the sun god shamanistic elements in apollo cult are often liked to his hyperborean origin and he is likewise speculated to have originated as solar shaman shamans like abaris and aristeas were also the followers of apollo who hailed from hyperborea in myths the tears of amber apollo shed when his son asclepius died became the waters of the river eridanos which surrounded hyperborea apollo also buried in hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the cyclopes he later gave this arrow to abaris childhood and youth as child apollo is said to have built foundation and an altar on delos using the horns of the goats that his sister artemis hunted since he learnt the art of building when young he later came to be known as archegetes the founder of towns and god who guided men to build new cities from his father zeus apollo had also received golden chariot drawn by swans phoebe gifts the oracular tripod to apollo by john flaxman in his early years when apollo spent his time herding cows he was reared by thriae the bee nymphs who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills apollo is also said to have invented the lyre and along with artemis the art of archery he then taught to the humans the art of healing and archery phoebe his grandmother gave the oracular shrine of delphi to apollo as birthday gift themis inspired him to be the oracular voice of delphi thereon python python pursuing leto and her children engravings on wood python chthonic serpent dragon was child of gaea and the guardian of the delphic oracle whose death was foretold by apollo when he was still in leto womb python was the nurse of the giant typhon in most of the traditions apollo was still child when he killed python python was sent by hera to hunt the pregnant leto to death and had assaulted her to avenge the trouble given to his mother apollo went in search of python and killed it in the sacred cave at delphi with the bow and arrows that he had received from hephaestus the delphian nymphs who were present encouraged apollo during the battle with the cry hie paean after apollo was victorious they also brought him gifts and gave the corycian cave to him according to homer apollo had encountered and killed the python when he was looking for place to establish his shrine according to another version when leto was in delphi python had attacked her apollo defended his mother and killed python euripides in his iphigenia in aulis gives an account of his fight with python and the events aftermath you killed him phoebus while still baby still leaping in the arms of your dear mother and you entered the holy shrine and sat on the golden tripod on your truthful throne distributing prophecies from the gods to mortals detailed account of apollo conflict with gaea and zeus intervention on behalf of his young son is also given but when apollo came and sent themis the child of earth away from the holy oracle of pytho earth gave birth to dream visions of the night and they told to the cities of men the present and what will happen in the future through dark beds of sleep on the ground and so earth took the office of prophecy away from phoebus in envy because of her daughter the lord made his swift way to olympus and wound his baby hands around zeus asking him to take the wrath of the earth goddess from the pythian home zeus smiled that the child so quickly came to ask for worship that pays in gold he shook his locks of hair put an end to the night voices and took away from mortals the truth that appears in darkness and gave the privilege back again to loxias apollo also demanded that all other methods of divination be made inferior to his wish that zeus granted him readily because of this athena who had been practicing divination by throwing pebbles cast her pebbles away in displeasure apollo killing the python by hendrik goltzius however apollo had committed blood murder and had to be purified because python was child of gaea gaea wanted apollo to be banished to tartarus as punishment zeus didn agree and instead exiled his son from olympus and instructed him to get purified apollo had to serve as slave for nine years after the servitude was over as per his father order he travelled to the vale of tempe to bath in waters of peneus there zeus himself performed purificatory rites on apollo purified apollo was escorted by his half sister athena to delphi where the oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by gaea according to variation apollo had also travelled to crete where carmanor purified him apollo later established the pythian games to appropriate gaea henceforth apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder and made men aware of their guilt and purified them soon after zeus instructed apollo to go to delphi and establish his law but apollo disobeying his father went to the land of hyperborea and stayed there for year he returned only after the delphians sang hymns to him and pleaded him to come back zeus pleased with his son integrity gave apollo the seat next to him on his right side he also gave to apollo various gifts like golden tripod golden bow and arrows golden chariot and the city of delphi apollo victorious over the python by françois gaspard adam soon after his return apollo needed to recruit people to delphi so when he spotted ship sailing from crete he sprang aboard in the form of dolphin the crew was awed into submission and followed course that led the ship to delphi there apollo revealed himself as god initiating them to his service he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts the pythia was apollo high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies pythia is arguably the constant favorite of apollo among the mortals tityos apollo slaying tityos attic red figure kylix bc hera once again sent another giant tityos to rape leto this time apollo shot him with his arrows and attacked him with his golden sword according to other version artemis also aided him in protecting their mother by attacking tityos with her arrows after the battle zeus finally relented his aid and hurled tityos down to tartarus there he was pegged to the rock floor covering an area of where pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver admetus apollo guards the herds or flocks of king admetus by felice gianni admetus was the king of pherae who was known for his hospitality when apollo was exiled from olympus for killing python he served as herdsman under admetus who was then young and unmarried apollo is said to have shared romantic relationship with admetus during his stay after completing his years of servitude apollo went back to olympus as god because admetus had treated apollo well the god conferred great benefits on him in return apollo mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins apollo helped admetus win the hand of alcestis the daughter of king pelias by taming lion and boar to draw admetus chariot he was present during their wedding to give his blessings when admetus angered the goddess artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister when apollo learnt of admetus untimely death he convinced or tricked the fates into letting admetus live past his time according to another version or perhaps some years later when zeus struck down apollo son asclepius with lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes who had fashioned the bolt for zeus apollo would have been banished to tartarus for this but his mother leto intervened and reminding zeus of their old love pleaded him not to kill their son zeus obliged and sentenced apollo to one year of hard labor once again under admetus the love between apollo and admetus was favored topic of roman poets like ovid and servius niobe niobe children are killed by apollo and diana by pierre charles jombert the fate of niobe was prophesied by apollo while he was still in leto womb niobe was the queen of thebes and wife of amphion she displayed hubris when she boasted that she was superior to leto because she had fourteen children niobids seven male and seven female while leto had only two she further mocked apollo effeminate appearance and artemis manly appearance leto insulted by this told her children to punish niobe accordingly apollo killed niobe sons and artemis her daughters according to some versions of the myth among the niobids chloris and her brother amyclas were not killed because they prayed to leto amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept her tears formed the river achelous zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them when chloris married and had children apollo granted her son nestor the years he had taken away from the niobids hence nestor was able to live for generations building the walls of troy once apollo and poseidon served under the trojan king laomedon in accordance to zeus words apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris apollo guarded the cattle of laomedon in the valleys of mount ida while poseidon built the walls of troy other versions make both apollo and poseidon the builders of the wall in ovid account apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre in pindar odes the gods took mortal named aeacus as their assistant when the work was completed three snakes rushed against the wall and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by aeacus apollo immediately prophesied that troy would fall at the hands of aeacus descendants the aeacidae his son telamon joined heracles when he sieged the city during laomedon rule later his great grandson neoptolemus was present in the wooden horse that lead to the downfall of troy laomedon refusing payment to poseidon and apollo by joachim von sandrart however the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised but also threatened to bind their feet and hands and sell them as slaves angered by the unpaid labour and the insults apollo infected the city with pestilence and posedion sent the sea monster cetus to deliver the city from it laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter hesione who would later be saved by heracles during his stay in troy apollo had lover named ourea who was nymph and daughter of poseidon together they had son named ileus whom apollo loved dearly trojan war apollo sided with the trojans during the trojan war waged by the greeks against the trojans during the war the greek king agamemnon captured chryseis the daughter of apollo priest chryses and refused to return her angered by this apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment he demanded that they return the girl and the achaeans greeks complied indirectly causing the anger of achilles which is the theme of the iliad apollo preceding hector with his aegis and dispersing the greeks by john flaxman receiving the aegis from zeus apollo entered the battlefield as per his father command causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry he pushed the greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers he is described as the rouser of armies because he rallied the trojan army when they were falling apart when zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war apollo was provoked by poseidon to duel however apollo declined to fight him saying that he wouldn fight his uncle for the sake of mortals apollo prevents diomedes from pursuing aeneas when the greek hero diomedes injured the trojan hero aeneas aphrodite tried to rescue him but diomedes injured her as well apollo then enveloped aeneas in cloud to protect him he repelled the attacks diomedes made on him and gave the hero stern warning to abstain himself from attacking god aeneas was then taken to pergamos sacred spot in troy where he was healed after the death of sarpedon son of zeus apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father wish and cleaned it he then gave it to sleep hypnos and death thanatos apollo had also once convinced athena to stop the war for that day so that the warriors can relieve themselves for while apollo protecting hector body by john flaxman the trojan hero hector who according to some was the god own son by hecuba was favored by apollo when he got severely injured apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms during duel with achilles when hector was about to lose apollo hid hector in cloud of mist to save him when the greek warrior patroclus tried to get into the fort of troy he was stopped by apollo encouraging hector to attack patroclus apollo stripped the armour of the greek warrior and broke his weapons patroclus was eventually killed by hector at last after hector fated death apollo protected his corpse from achilles attempt to mutilate it by creating magical cloud over the corpse achilles slaying troilus apollo held grudge against achilles throughout the war because achilles had murdered his son tenes before the war began and brutally assassinated his son troilus in his own temple not only did apollo save hector from achilles he also tricked achilles by disguising himself as trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates he foiled achilles attempt to mutilate hector dead body finally apollo caused achilles death by guiding an arrow shot by paris into achilles heel in some versions apollo himself killed achilles by taking the disguise of paris apollo helped many trojan warriors including agenor polydamas glaucus in the battlefield though he greatly favored the trojans apollo was bound to follow the orders of zeus and served his father loyally during the war heracles after heracles then named alcides was struck with madness and killed his family he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of apollo apollo through the pythia commanded him to serve king eurystheus for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him only then would alcides be absolved of his sin apollo also renamed him as heracles heracles and apollo struggling over the hind as depicted on corinthian helmet early th century bc to complete his third task heracles had to capture the ceryneian hind hind sacred to artemis and bring it alive he chased the hind for one year when the animal eventually got tired and tried crossing the river ladon he captured it while he was taking it back he was confronted by apollo and artemis who were angered at heracles for this act however heracles soothed the goddess and explained his situation to her after much pleading artemis permitted him to take the hind and told him to return it later heracles steals apollo tripod attic black figure oinochoe ca bc after he was freed from his servitude to eurystheus heracles fell in conflict with iphytus prince of oechalia and murdered him soon after he contracted terrible disease he consulted the oracle of apollo once again in hope of ridding himself of the disease the pythia however denied to give any prophesy in anger heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started walking away intending to start his own oracle however apollo did not tolerate this and stopped heracles duel ensued between them artemis rushed to support apollo while athena supported heracles soon zeus threw his thunderbolt between the fighting brothers and separated them he reprimanded heracles for this act of violation and asked apollo to give solution to heracles apollo then ordered the hero to serve under omphale queen of lydia for one year in order to purify himself periphas periphas was an attican king and priest of apollo he was noble just and rich he did all his duties justly because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as zeus at one point they worshipped periphas in place of zeus and set up shrines and temples for him this annoyed zeus who decided to annihilate the entire family of periphas but because he was just king and good devotee apollo intervened and requested his father to spare periphas zeus considered apollo words and agreed to let him live but he metamorphosed periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds when periphas wife requested zeus to let her stay with her husband zeus turned her into vulture and fulfilled her wish plato concept of soulmates long time ago there were three kinds of human beings male descended from the sun female descended from the earth and androgynous descended from the moon each human being was completely round with four arms and fours legs two identical faces on opposite sides of head with four ears and all else to match they were powerful and unruly otis and ephialtes even dared to scale mount olympus to check their insolence zeus devised plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them he cut them all in two and asked apollo to make necessary repairs giving humans the individual shape they still have now apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds he pulled together their skin at the abdomen and sewed the skin together at the middle of it this is what we call navel today he smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest but he made sure to leave few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment as he zeus cut them one after another he bade apollo give the face and the half of the neck turn apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and compose their forms so apollo gave turn to the face and pulled the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly like the purses which draw in and he made one mouth at the centre of the belly which he fastened in knot the same which is called the navel he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles much as shoemaker might smooth leather upon last he left few wrinkles however in the region of the belly and navel as memorial of the primeval state nurturer of the young apollo kourotrophos is the god who nurtures and protects children and the young especially boys he oversees their education and their passage into adulthood education is said to have originated from apollo and the muses many myths have him train his children it was custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to apollo after reaching adulthood chiron the abandoned centaur was fostered by apollo who instructed him in medicine prophecy archery and more chiron would later become great teacher himself asclepius in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts by his father however he was later entrusted to chiron for further education anius apollo son by rhoeo was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts anius later became the priest of apollo and the king of delos iamus was the son of apollo and evadne when evadne went into labour apollo sent the moirai to assist his lover after the child was born apollo sent snakes to feed the child some honey when iamus reached the age of education apollo took him to olympia and taught him many arts including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds idmon was educated by apollo to be seer even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the argonauts he embraced his destiny and died brave death to commemorate his son bravery apollo commanded boetians to build town around the tomb of the hero and to honor him apollo adopted carnus the abandoned son of zeus and europa he reared the child with the help of his mother leto and educated him to be seer when his son melaneus reached the age of marriage apollo asked the princess stratonice to be his son bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed apollo saved shepherd boy name unknown from death in large deep cave by the means of vultures to thank him the shepherd built apollo temple under the name vulturius god of music immediately after his birth apollo demanded lyre and invented the paean thus becoming the god of music as the divine singer he is the patron of poets singers and musicians the invention of string music is attributed to him plato said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music rhythm and harmony is the gift of apollo and the muses according to socrates ancient greeks believed that apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together both for the gods and the humans for this reason he was called homopolon before the homo was replaced by apollo harmonious music delivered people from their pain and hence like dionysus he is also called the liberator the swans which were considered to be the most musical among the birds were believed to be the singers of apollo they are apollo sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to hyperborea aelian says that when the singers would sing hymns to apollo the swans would join the chant in unison among the pythagoreans the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of apollo their principal deity their belief was that the music purifies the soul just as medicine purifies the body they also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos evolving into an idea known as the music of the spheres the music of the spheres shown in this engraving from renaissance italy are apollo the muses the planetary spheres and musical ratios apollo appears as the companion of the muses and as musagetes leader of muses he leads them in dance they spend their time on parnassus which is one of their sacred places apollo is also the lover of the muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like orpheus and linus apollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the lyre in his role as the god of banquets he was always present to play music in weddings of the gods like the marriage of eros and psyche peleus and thetis he is frequent guest of the bacchanalia and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the maenads and satyrs apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others he was the victor in all those contests but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their hubris apollo and the muses on parnassus by andrea appiani apollo lyre the invention of lyre is attributed either to hermes or to apollo himself distinctions have been made that hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell whereas the lyre apollo invented was regular lyre myths tell that the infant hermes stole number of apollo cows and took them to cave in the woods near pylos covering their tracks in the cave he found tortoise and killed it then removed the insides he used one of the cow intestines and the tortoise shell and made his lyre the friendship of apollo and hermes by noël coypel upon discovering the theft apollo confronted hermes and asked him to return his cattle when hermes acted innocent apollo took the matter to zeus zeus having seen the events sided with apollo and ordered hermes to return the cattle hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre hence apollo then became the master of the lyre detail of apollo lyre according to other versions apollo had invented the lyre himself whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to marsyas hermes lyre therefore would be reinvention contest with pan the musical duel of pan and apollo by laurits tuxen once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge the god of music to contest the mountain god tmolus was chosen to umpire pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present then apollo struck the strings of his lyre it was so beautiful that tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and everyone was pleased with the judgement only midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award apollo did not want to suffer such depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of donkey contest with marsyas marsyas was satyr who was punished by apollo for his hubris he had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy athena had also placed curse upon the instrument that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished when marsyas played the flute everyone became frenzied with joy this led marsyas to think that he was better than apollo and he challenged the god to musical contest the contest was judged by the muses or the nymphs of nysa athena was also present to witness the contest athena and marsyas marsyas taunted apollo for wearing his hair long for having fair face and smooth body for his skill in so many arts he also further said his apollo hair is smooth and made into tufts and curls that fall about his brow and hang before his face his body is fair from head to foot his limbs shine bright his tongue gives oracles and he is equally eloquent in prose or verse propose which you will what of his robes so fine in texture so soft to the touch aglow with purple what of his lyre that flashes gold gleams white with ivory and shimmers with rainbow gems what of his song so cunning and so sweet nay all these allurements suit with naught save luxury to virtue they bring shame alone the muses and athena sniggered at this comment the contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could do whatever he wanted to the loser the contest between apollo and marsyas by palma il giovane according to one account after the first round they both were deemed equal by the nysiads but in the next round apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance marsyas argued against this saying that apollo would have an advantage and accused apollo of cheating but apollo replied that since marsyas played the flute which needed air blown from the throat it was similar to singing and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all the nymphs decided that apollo argument was just apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time mesmerising the audience marsyas could not do this apollo was declared the winner and angered with marsyas haughtiness and his accusations decided to flay the satyr according to another account marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat out of shame he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for wine sack another variation is that apollo played his instrument upside down marsyas could not do this with his instrument so the muses who were the judges declared apollo the winner apollo hung marsyas from tree to flay him marsyas flayed by the order of apollo by charles andré van loo apollo flayed the limbs of marsyas alive in cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge god he then gave the rest of his body for proper burial and nailed marsyas flayed skin to nearby pine tree as lesson to the others marsyas blood turned into the river marsyas but apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away the lyre was later discovered by the muses and apollo sons linus and orpheus the muses fixed the middle string linus the string struck with the forefinger and orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it they took it back to apollo but the god who had decided to stay away from music for while laid away both the lyre and the pipes at delphi and joined cybele in her wanderings to as far as hyperborea contest with cinyras cinyras was ruler of cyprus who was friend of agamemnon

sister of apollo is thea apollousa that is she as female divinity represented the same idea that apollo did as male divinity in the pre hellenic period their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife and there seems to have been tradition which actually described artemis as the wife of apollo however this relationship was never sexual but spiritual which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the hellenic period apollo and artemis by gavin hamilton artemis like her brother is armed with bow and arrows she is the cause of sudden deaths of women she also is the protector of the young especially girls though she has nothing to do with oracles music or poetry she sometimes led the female chorus on olympus while apollo sang the laurel daphne was sacred to both artemis daphnaia had her temple among the lacedemonians at place called hypsoi apollo daphnephoros had temple in eretria place where the citizens are to take the oaths in later times when apollo was

children they were given more powers and duties apollo and athena often took up the role as protectors of cities and were patrons of some of the important cities athena was the principle goddess of athens apollo was the principle god of sparta pallas athene visiting apollo on the parnassus by arnold houbraken as patrons of arts apollo and athena were companions of the muses the former much more frequent companion than the latter apollo was sometimes called the son of athena and hephaestus due to his wise and artistic nature in the trojan war as zeus executive apollo is seen holding the aegis like athena usually does apollo decisions were usually approved by his sister athena and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by zeus apollo in the oresteia in aeschylus oresteia trilogy clytemnestra kills her husband king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnon son orestes is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus her lover orestes and pylades carry out the revenge and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes or furies female of vengeance apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage they invade his temple and he drives them away he says that the matter should be brought before athena apollo promises to protect orestes as orestes has become apollo supplicant apollo advocates orestes at the trial and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo roman apollo the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks as greek god apollo had no direct roman equivalent although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus there was tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus on the occasion of pestilence in the bce apollo first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinare during the second punic war in bce the ludi apollinares apollonian games were instituted in his honor on the instructions of prophecy attributed to one marcius in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome after the battle of actium which was fought near sanctuary of apollo augustus enlarged apollo temple dedicated portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour he also erected new temple to the god on the palatine hill sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games held in bce to celebrate the dawn of new era festivals the chief apollonian festival was the pythian games held every four years at delphi and was one of the four great panhellenic games also of major importance was the delia held every four years on delos athenian annual festivals included the boedromia metageitnia pyanepsia and thargelia spartan annual festivals were the carneia and the hyacinthia thebes every nine years held the daphnephoria attributes and symbols apollo most common attributes were the bow and arrow other attributes of his included the kithara an advanced version of the common lyre the plectrum and the sword another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers the pythian games were held in apollo honor every four years at delphi the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games gold stater of the seleucid king antiochus soter reigned bce showing on the reverse nude apollo holding his key attributes two arrows and bow the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos animals sacred to apollo included wolves dolphins roe deer swans cicadas symbolizing music and song ravens hawks crows apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers snakes referencing apollo function as the god of prophecy mice and griffins mythical eagle lion hybrids of eastern origin homer and porphyry wrote that apollo had hawk as his messenger in many myths apollo is transformed into hawk in addition claudius aelianus wrote that in ancient egypt people believed that hawks were sacred to the god and that according to the ministers of apollo in egypt there were certain men called hawk keepers ἱερακοβοσκοί who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god eusebius wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of apollo in egypt and that the city symbol is man with hawklike face horus claudius aelianus wrote that egyptians called apollo horus in their own language apollo citharoedus apollo with kithara musei capitolini rome as god of colonization apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization bce according to greek tradition he helped cretan or arcadian colonists found the city of troy however this story may reflect cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention minor asian god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars in this interpretation apollo title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia which effectively severs the god supposed link with wolves possibly folk etymology in literary contexts apollo represents harmony order and reason characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who represents ecstasy and disorder the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase apollo is often associated with the golden mean this is the greek ideal of moderation and virtue that opposes gluttony apollo in the arts the louvre apollo sauroctonos roman copy after praxiteles bc apollo is common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance the earliest greek word for statue is delight agalma and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision greek art puts into apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings but they also embodied in concrete form issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially religious activity the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment the statues of apollo embody beauty balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world the evolution of the greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal kouros type in early archaic period to the representation of motion in relative harmonious whole in late archaic period in classical greece the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole method created by polykleitos finally praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities and his masterpieces are mixture of naturalism with stylization art and greek philosophy the evolution of the greek art seems to go parallel with the greek philosophical conceptions which changed from the natural philosophy of thales to the metaphysical theory of pythagoras thales searched for simple material form directly perceptible by the senses behind the appearances of things and his theory is also related to the older animism this was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life through unnaturally simplified forms pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics and that the forms were based on transcendental mathematical relation the forms on earth are imperfect imitations eikones images of the celestial world of numbers his ideas had great influence on post archaic art the greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation that would lead to the esthetic perfection canon in classical greece anaxagoras asserted that divine reason mind gave order to the seeds of the universe and plato extended the greek belief of ideal forms to his metaphysical theory of forms ideai ideas the forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas the greek words oida know and eidos species thing seen have the same root as the word idea thing ἰδείν to see indicating how the greek mind moved from the gift of the senses to the principles beyond the senses the artists in plato time moved away from his theories and art tends to be mixture of naturalism with stylization the greek sculptors considered the senses more important and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual archaic sculpture kerameikos archaeological museum in athens kouros male youth is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the archaic period in greece this type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of apollo the first statues are certainly still and formal the formality of their stance seems to be related with the egyptian precedent but it was accepted for good reason the sculptors had clear idea of what young man is and embodied the archaic smile of good manners the firm and springy step the balance of the body dignity and youthful happiness when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods the adoption of standard recognizable type for long time is probably because nature gives preference in survival of type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions and also due to the general greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms that can be imagined and represented these forms expressed immortality apollo was the immortal god of ideal balance and order his shrine in delphi that he shared in winter with dionysius had the inscriptions gnōthi seautón know thyself and mēdén ágan nothing in excess and eggýa pára atē make pledge and mischief is nigh new york kouros met mus marble bc metropolitan museum of art in the first large scale depictions during the early archaic period bc the artists tried to draw one attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses but as being full of life the greeks maintained until late in their civilization an almost animistic idea that the statues are in some sense alive this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself fine example is the statue of the sacred gate kouros which was found at the cemetery of dipylon in athens dipylon kouros the statue is the thing in itself and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity according to the greek tradition the dipylon master was named daedalus and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body giving the impression that the statues could move it is considered that he created also the new york kouros which is the oldest fully preserved statue of kouros type and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself piraeus apollo archaic style bronze archaeological museum of piraeus the animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality is sanctified in the homeric poems and in greek myths in stories of the god hephaestus phaistos and the mythic daedalus the builder of the labyrinth that made images which moved of their own accord this kind of art goes back to the minoan period when its main theme was the representation of motion in specific moment these free standing statues were usually marble but also the form rendered in limestone bronze ivory and terracotta the earliest examples of life sized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos such statues were found across the greek speaking world the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios boeotia alone the last stage in the development of the kouros type is the late archaic period bc in which the greek sculpture attained full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create relative harmonious whole ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze piraeus apollo it was found in piraeus the harbour of athens the statue originally held the bow in its left hand and cup of pouring libation in its right hand it probably comes from north eastern peloponnesus the emphasis is given in anatomy and it is one of the first attempts to represent kind of motion and beauty relative to proportions which appear mostly in post archaic art the statue throws some light on an artistic centre which with an independently developed harder simpler and heavier style restricts ionian influence in athens finally this is the germ from which the art of polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later classical sculpture apollo of the mantoua type marble roman copy after th century bce greek original attributed to polykleitos musée du louvre at the beginning of the classical period it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else consisted of symmetry and proportions the artists tried also to represent motion in specific moment myron which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant minoan element anatomy and geometry are fused in one and each does something to the other the greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions just as they sought some reality behind appearances polykleitos in his canon wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements materials but of the parts that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole it seems that he was influenced by the theories of pythagoras the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm the type is represented by neo attic imperial roman copies of the late st or early nd century modelled upon supposed greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the th century bce in style similar to works of polykleitos but more archaic the apollo held the cythara against his extended left arm of which in the louvre example fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps though the proportions were always important in greek art the appeal of the greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone the statues of apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the minoan period and in the beliefs of the first greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze age just as the greeks saw the mountains forests sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form and the form of work of art spiritual life is incorporated in matter when it is given artistic form just as in the arts the greeks sought some reality behind appearances so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect as to the whole sentient self things as we see them and as they really are are one that each stresses the nature of the other in single unity pediments and friezes temple of zeus olympia greece in the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples the artists had problem to fit group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base the siphnian treasury in delphi was one of the first greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling the pediment shows the story of heracles stealing apollo tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration their two figures hold the centre in the pediment of the temple of zeus in olympia the single figure of apollo is dominating the scene head of the apollo belvedere these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space but only as parts in larger whole while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals to suggest passage to and from busy battlefield the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order and this was improved when classical art brought greater freedom and economy hellenistic greece rome apollo as handsome beardless young man is often depicted with kithara as apollo citharoedus or bow in his hand or reclining on tree the apollo lykeios and apollo sauroctonos types the apollo belvedere is marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late th century for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans from the renaissance through the th century the marble is hellenistic or roman copy of bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares made between and bce the life size so called adonis found in on the site of villa suburbana near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars in the late nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem roman thysdrus he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo though now even god divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire another haloed apollo in mosaic from hadrumentum is in the museum at sousse the conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted large eyed curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the rd century bce to depict alexander the great some time after this mosaic was executed the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed modern reception apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature percy bysshe shelley composed hymn of apollo and the god instruction of the muses formed the subject of igor stravinsky apollon musagète in the canadian band rush released an album with songs apollo bringer of wisdom dionysus bringer of love in discussion of the arts distinction is sometimes made between the apollonian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity friedrich nietzsche argued that fusion of the two was most desirable carl jung apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over intellectualise and maintain emotional distance charles handy in gods of management uses greek gods as metaphor to portray various types of organisational culture apollo represents role culture where

five sets which was an important win for agassi who had lost of the previous matches against sampras in arguably their most memorable match ever sampras defeated agassi in the us open quarterfinals in four sets there were no breaks of serve during the entire match reruns of the match are frequently featured on television especially during us open rain delays and the match is considered one of the best in history because of the level of play presented by both players their last meeting was the final of the us open which was their third meeting in us open final but the first since the match was also notable because they had defeated several up and coming players en route to the final sampras had defeated no tommy haas in the fourth round and future no andy roddick in the quarterfinals while agassi had defeated no and defending champion lleyton hewitt in the semi finals sampras defeated agassi in four sets this was the final atp tour singles match of sampras career agassi vs chang michael chang was the opponent agassi faced most frequently from all the players other than sampras they met times on the tour level with agassi leading chang unlike most of agassi big rivals had playing style similar to his both players preferred to stay at the baseline with chang being more defensive minded the outcome was that most of their meetings were built on long and entertaining rallies the rivalry began late in the with both players being considered the prodigies of the next great generation of american tennis players and both having foreign descent agassi won the first four matches including straight set victory in round of the us open and defeating chang the defending champion in the french open in four set quarterfinal arguably their best match took place in round of the us open while both players presented high quality shot making the momentum changed from set to set with agassi eventually prevailing in five set victory it turned out to be the toughest contest on his way to his first us open title their next two grand slam meetings came in with chang recording easy straight set victories in the semi finals of both the australian open and the us open years after agassi shockingly admitted in his book that he had lost the first of the matches on purpose as he did not want to face boris becker who was awaiting the winner in the final agassi won the last four of their matches with the last being in at the miami open with chang being clearly past his prime agassi vs becker boris becker and agassi played times with agassi leading becker won their first three matches in and before agassi reversed the rivalry in and won of their last matches they first played at indian wells in with becker prevailing their most notable match was the davis cup semi final match which becker won in five sets after losing the first two in tiebreaks agassi considered baseliner with playing style not suiting grass shocked becker three time champion in five set quarterfinal at wimbledon in on his way to his first grand slam title the intensity of the rivalry peaked in becker won that year wimbledon semi final after being down set and two breaks to eventually win in four sets in highly anticipated rematch in the us open semi final this time it was agassi who came out victorious in four tight sets their final match was played at hong kong in which agassi won in three sets agassi vs rafter agassi and pat rafter played fifteen times with agassi leading the rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters because of the players contrasting styles of play with rafter using traditional serve volley methods against agassi variety of return of serves and passing shots as his main weapons agassi led on hard courts but rafter surprisingly won their sole match on clay at the rome masters they played four matches at wimbledon with both winning two matches each agassi won the first two in and while rafter took their and encounters both of the gruelling setters often being presented on the lists of best matches ever played agassi also won both their meetings at the australian open in and on his way to the title on both occasions rafter however took their only us open encounter in and went on to win the title agassi vs federer agassi and roger federer played times and federer led their head to head series with the retirement of sampras the rivalry against the years younger federer who was another great server like sampras became agassi main rivalry for the final years of his career agassi won their first three matches but then went on to lose eight consecutive ones they first met in just the third tournament of federer career at the swiss indoors in federer hometown with agassi prevailing over the year old agassi also defeated federer at the us open and the finals of the miami open in federer began to turn the tide at the masters cup in when he defeated agassi in both the round robin and the final they played memorable quarterfinal match at the us open that spanned over two windy days with federer eventually prevailing in five sets at the dubai championships federer and agassi attracted worldwide headlines with publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on helipad almost meters above sea level at the hotel burj al arab their final duel took place in the final of the us open in the historic clash of generations federer was victorious in four sets in front of pro agassi crowd the match was the last appearance by agassi in any tournament final agassi vs lendl agassi and ivan lendl played times and lendl led their head to head series agassi vs edberg agassi and stefan edberg played times and agassi led their head to head series earnings agassi earned more than million in prize money

the victims of the earthquake partnered with roger federer and rafael nadal the old rivals began making jokes at each other expense which ended up with sampras intentionally striking serve at agassi body after the event agassi admitted that he had crossed the line with his jokes and publicly apologized to sampras agassi and sampras met again one year later for an exhibition match at madison square garden in new york in front of spectators as sampras defeated agassi in two sets on march agassi and sampras squared off for an exhibition in london for the annual world tennis day this time it was agassi who came out on top in two straight sets he returned to the tour in may in the position of coach to novak djokovic for the french open agassi announced the end of the partnership on march stating that there were too many disagreements in the relationship playing style early in his career agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first strike tennis typically by inducing weak return with deep hard shot and then playing winner at an extreme angle on the rare occasion that he charged the net agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit swinging volley for winner his favored groundstroke was his flat accurate two handed backhand hit well cross court but especially down the line his forehand was nearly as strong especially his inside out to the ad court agassi strength was in dictating play from the baseline and he was able to consistently take the ball on the rise while he was growing up his father and nick bollettieri trained him in this way when in control of point agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt winner and hit conservative shot to minimize his errors and to make his opponent run more this change to more methodical less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach brad gilbert in their first year together in gilbert encouraged agassi to wear out opponents with his deep flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars and noted agassi two handed backhand down the line as his very best shot signature play later in his career was change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes this would often be followed by passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it agassi was raised on hardcourts but found much of his early major tournament success on the red clay of roland garros reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career despite grass being his worst surface his first major win was at the slick grass of wimbledon in tournament that he professed to hating at the time his strongest surface over the course of his career was indeed hardcourt where he won six of his eight majors business ventures agassi

the austroasiatic languages also known as mon khmer are large language family of mainland southeast asia also scattered throughout parts of india bangladesh nepal and southern china there are around million speakers of austroasiatic languages of these languages only vietnamese khmer and mon have long established recorded history and only vietnamese and khmer have official status as modern national languages in vietnam and cambodia respectively the mon language is recognised indigenous language in myanmar and thailand in myanmar the wa language is the de facto official language of wa state santali is one of the scheduled languages of india the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status ethnologue identifies austroasiatic languages these form thirteen established families plus perhaps shompen which is poorly attested as fourteenth which have traditionally been grouped into two as mon khmer and munda however one recent classification posits three groups munda nuclear mon khmer and khasi khmuic while another has abandoned mon khmer as taxon altogether making it synonymous with the larger family austroasiatic languages have disjunct distribution across southeast asia and parts of india bangladesh nepal and east asia separated by regions where other languages are spoken they appear to be the extant autochthonous languages of mainland southeast asia excluding the andaman islands with the neighboring kra dai hmong mien austronesian and sino tibetan languages being the result of later migrations etymology the name austroasiatic comes from combination of the latin words for south and asia hence south asia typology regarding word structure austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic sesquisyllabic pattern with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial unstressed reduced minor syllable followed by stressed full syllable this reduction of presyllables has led to variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original proto austroasiatic prefixes such as the causative prefix ranging from cvc syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants as for word formation most austroasiatic languages have variety of derivational prefixes many have infixes but suffixes are almost completely non existent in most branches except munda and few specialized exceptions in other austroasiatic branches the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast either between modal normal voice and breathy lax voice or between modal voice and creaky voice languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have three or even four way voicing contrast however some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in few cases such as vietnamese tonogenesis vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by chinese that its original austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of south chinese languages whereas khmer which had more influence from sanskrit has retained more typically austroasiatic structure proto language much work has been done on the reconstruction of proto mon khmer in harry shorto mon khmer comparative dictionary little work has been done on the munda languages which are not well documented with their demotion from primary branch proto mon khmer becomes synonymous with proto austroasiatic paul sidwell reconstructs the consonant inventory of proto mon khmer as follows this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for is better preserved in the katuic languages which sidwell has specialized in internal classification linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic the mon khmer languages of southeast asia northeast india and the nicobar islands and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh parts of nepal however no evidence for this classification has ever been published each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as valid clade by contrast the relationships between these families within austroasiatic are debated in addition to the traditional classification two recent proposals are given neither of which accepts traditional mon khmer as valid unit however little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review in addition there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of acehnese in sumatra diffloth the chamic languages of vietnam and the land dayak languages of borneo adelaar diffloth diffloth widely cited original classification now abandoned by diffloth himself is used in encyclopædia britannica and except for the breakup of southern mon khmer in ethnologue munda north munda korku kherwarian south munda kharia juang koraput munda mon khmer eastern mon khmer khmer cambodian pearic bahnaric katuic vietic includes vietnamese northern mon khmer khasi meghalaya india palaungic khmuic southern mon khmer mon aslian malaya nicobarese nicobar islands peiros peiros is lexicostatistic classification based on percentages of shared vocabulary this means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to language contact indeed when sidwell replicated peiros study with languages known well enough to account for loans he did not find the internal branching structure below upright nicobarese munda khmer munda mon khmer khasi nuclear mon khmer mangic mang palyu perhaps in northern mk vietic perhaps in northern mk northern mon khmer palaungic khmuic central mon khmer khmer dialects pearic asli bahnaric aslian mon bahnaric monic katu bahnaric katuic bahnaric diffloth diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations though like other classifications the evidence has not been published as schematic we have or in more detail munda languages india koraput languages core munda languages kharian juang languages north munda languages korku kherwarian languages khasi khmuic languages northern mon khmer khasian languages of north eastern india and adjacent region of bangladesh palaungo khmuic languages khmuic languages of laos and thailand palaungo pakanic languages pakanic or palyu or languages of southern china and vietnam palaungic languages of burma southern china and thailand nuclear mon khmer languages khmero vietic languages eastern mon khmer vieto katuic languages vietic languages of vietnam and laos including the vietnamese language which has the most speakers of any austroasiatic language katuic languages of laos vietnam and thailand khmero bahnaric languages bahnaric languages of vietnam laos and cambodia khmeric languages the khmer dialects of cambodia thailand and vietnam pearic languages of cambodia nico monic languages southern mon khmer nicobarese languages of the nicobar islands territory of india asli monic languages aslian languages of peninsular malaysia and thailand monic languages the mon language of burma and the nyahkur language of thailand this family tree is consistent with recent studies of migration of chromosomal haplogroup however the dates obtained from by zhivotovsky method dna studies are several times older than that given by linguists the route map of the people with haplogroup speaking this language can be seen in this link other geneticists criticise the zhivotovsky method sidwell paul sidwell and roger blench propose that the austroasiatic phylum dispersed via the mekong river drainage basin paul sidwell in comparison of languages which are well known enough to exclude loan words finds little evidence for internal branching though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence sidwell blench discuss this proposal in more detail and note that there is good evidence for khasi palaungic node which could also possibly be closely related to khmuic if this would the case sidwell blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had spread westward sidwell blench suggest shompen as an additional branch and believe that vieto katuic connection is worth investigating in general however the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for deeply nested structure to have developed since proto austroasiatic speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the central mekong river valley relatively quickly subsequently sidwell proposed that nicobarese subgroups with aslian just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each other subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis of the austroasiatic language family by sidwell suggests that austroasiatic branches may have loosely nested structure rather than completely rake like structure with an east west division consisting of munda khasic palaungic and khmuic forming western group as opposed to all of the other branches occurring possibly as early as years before present integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings paul sidwell further expanded his mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into indochina from the lingnan area of southern china with the subsequent mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of neolithic farmers from southern china sidwell tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up years during the neolithic transition era of mainland southeast asia with all the major branches of austroasiatic formed by austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the pearl river watershed of lingnan which would have been either coastal route down the coast of vietnam or downstream through the mekong river via yunnan both the reconstructed lexicon of proto austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early austroasiatic speakers around cultivated rice and millet kept livestock such as dogs pigs and chickens and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments at this neolithic package suddenly arrived in indochina from the lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre neolithic hunter gatherer cultures with grain husks found in northern indochina by and in southern indochina by however sidwell found that iron is not reconstructable in proto austroasiatic since each austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from tai chinese tibetan malay and other languages during the iron age about relatively young austroasiatic branches in indochina such as vietic katuic pearic and khmer were formed while the more internally diverse bahnaric branch dating to about underwent more extensive internal diversification by the iron age all of the austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present day locations with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking place during the iron age paul sidwell considers the austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around years during the arrival of rice agriculture in indochina but notes that the origin of proto austroasiatic itself is older than that date the lexicon of proto austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum the early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts animal names natural features and pronouns while the names of cultural items agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts which are reconstructable in proto austroasiatic form part of the later stratum roger blench suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies such as boats waterways river fauna and fish capture techniques can be reconstructed for proto austroasiatic blench finds widespread austroasiatic roots for river valley boat fish catfish sp eel prawn shrimp central austroasiatic crab tortoise turtle otter crocodile heron fishing bird and fish trap archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern indochina northern vietnam laos and other nearby areas dates back to only about years bc with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the yangtze valley where it has been dated to hence this points to relatively late riverine dispersal of austroasiatic as compared to sino tibetan whose speakers had distinct non riverine culture in addition to living an aquatic based lifestyle early austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock crops and newer types of watercraft as early austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area such as sino tibetan possible extinct branches roger blench also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of austroasiatic that are now extinct based on substrate evidence in modern day languages pre chamic languages the languages of coastal vietnam prior to the chamic migrations chamic has various austroasiatic loanwords that cannot be clearly traced to existing austroasiatic branches sidwell larish also notes that moklenic languages contain many austroasiatic loanwords some of which are similar to the ones found in chamic acehnese substratum sidwell acehnese has many basic words that are of austroasiatic origin suggesting that either austronesian speakers have absorbed earlier austroasiatic residents in northern sumatra or that words might have been borrowed from austroasiatic languages in southern vietnam or perhaps combination of both sidwell argues that acehnese and chamic had often borrowed austroasiatic words independently of each other while some austroasiatic words can be traced back to proto aceh chamic sidwell accepts that acehnese and chamic are related but that they had separated from each other before chamic had borrowed most of its austroasiatic lexicon bornean substrate languages blench blench cites austroasiatic origin words in modern day bornean branches such as land dayak bidayuh dayak bakatiq etc dusunic central dusun visayan etc kayan and kenyah noting especially resemblances with aslian as further evidence for his proposal blench also cites ethnographic evidence such as musical instruments in borneo shared in common with austroasiatic speaking groups in mainland southeast asia adelaar has also noticed phonological and lexical similarities between land dayak and aslian lepcha substratum rongic many words of austroasiatic origin have been noticed in lepcha suggesting sino tibetan superstrate laid over an austroasiatic substrate blench calls this branch rongic based on the lepcha autonym róng other languages with proposed austroasiatic substrata are jiamao based on evidence from the register system of jiamao hlai language thurgood jiamao is known for its highly aberrant vocabulary in relation to other hlai languages kerinci van reijn notes that kerinci malayic language of central sumatra shares many phonological similarities with austroasiatic languages such as sesquisyllabic word structure and vowel inventory john peterson suggests that pre munda languages may have once dominated the eastern indo gangetic plain and were then absorbed by indo aryan languages at an early date as indo aryan spread east peterson notes that eastern indo aryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of munda languages while western indo aryan languages do not writing systems other than latin based alphabets many austroasiatic languages are written with the khmer thai lao and burmese alphabets vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on chinese logographic writing this has since been supplanted by the latin alphabet in the th century the following are examples of past used alphabets or current alphabets of austroasiatic languages chữ nôm khmer alphabet khom script used for short period in the early th century for indigenous languages in laos mon script mundari bani mundari alphabet ol chiki alphabet santali alphabet pahawh hmong was once used to write khmu under the name pahawh khmu sorang sompeng alphabet sora alphabet tai le palaung blang tai tham blang warang citi ho alphabet external relations austric languages austroasiatic is an integral part of the controversial austric hypothesis which also includes the austronesian languages and in some proposals also the kra dai languages and the hmong mien languages hmong mien several lexical resemblances are found between the hmong mien and austroasiatic language families ratliff some of which had earlier been proposed by haudricourt this could imply relation or early language contact along the yangtze according to cai et al hmong mien is at least partially related to austroasiatic but was heavily influenced by sino tibetan especially tibeto burman languages indo aryan languages it is suggested that the austroasiatic languages have some influence on indo aryan languages including sanskrit and middle indo aryan languages indian linguist suniti kumar chatterji pointed that specific number of substantives in languages such as hindi punjabi and bengali were borrowed from munda languages additionally french linguist jean przyluski suggested similarity between the tales from the austroasiatic realm and the indian mythological stories of matsyagandha from mahabharata and the nāgas austroasiatic migrations mitsuru sakitani suggests that haplogroup which is common in austroasiatic people and some other ethnic groups in southern china and haplogroup which is common in today japanese koreans and some manchu are the carriers of yangtze civilization baiyue another study suggests that the haplogroup is the major austroasiatic paternal lineage and the para austroasiatic lineage of the yayoi people migration into india according to chaubey et al austro asiatic speakers in india today are derived from dispersal from southeast asia followed by extensive sex specific admixture with local indian populations according to riccio et al the munda people are likely descended from austroasiatic migrants from southeast asia according to zhang et al austroasiatic migrations from southeast asia into india took place after the last glacial maximum circa years ago arunkumar et al suggest austroasiatic
